<p>I keep getting asked about this and people keep advocating it, so let's talk about it.</p><p>The issue is a&nbsp;<em>Constitutional Convention</em>, with the expressed intent being to return the United States to its&nbsp;<em>Constitutional Roots.</em></p><p>Sounds like a good idea, yes?</p><p>Well, it quite arguably is, if you'd like to see the government return to its Constitutional boundaries.</p><p>The problem is that this "remedy" isn't a remedy and if it comes to pass what you want&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>won't</strong></span> happen. &nbsp;</p><p>I know this for a fact and, if you think about it, so do you.</p><p>I know what you're going to say:&nbsp;<em>How can you be so sure?</em></p><p>It's simple:&nbsp;<strong>There is nothing wrong with the Constitution as it sits now. &nbsp;The problem is that it's not followed.</strong></p><p>Let's just take one example: <em>The Fourth Amendment</em></p><p>It reads:</p><blockquote><p>Amendment IV<br />The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, <strong>shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.</strong></p></blockquote><p>It does not say:</p><p><em>a) Except</em><em>&nbsp;when a police officer wants to stop and frisk you.</em></p><p><em>b) Except when the government thinks you might be a terrorist.</em></p><p><em>c) Except when someone else has your "papers" because you had to let them have same as an essential part of buying a service from them (e.g. your cell phone "tower" records.)</em></p><p><em>d) Except when you're driving while black.</em></p><p><em>e) Except when you're driving anywhere, at all, and the government thinks you might have drug money in the car but has no probable cause to believe so.</em></p><p>And on and on and on.</p><p>It says&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>shall not be violated</strong></span>, and it further mandates that a warrant may&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>only</strong></span> issue predicated on probable cause,&nbsp;<em><strong>supported by oath or affirmation&nbsp;</strong></em>(not the <em><strong>unsworn</strong></em> word of an unnamed "confidential informant" <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>nor</strong></span> can a dog "swear an oath")&nbsp;<strong>and that the particular place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized must be named. &nbsp;</strong>That latter requirement is there so the cops can't go on fishing expeditions.</p><p>Let's try another one:</p><blockquote><p>Amendment II<br />A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state,<strong> the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.</strong></p></blockquote><p>It does not say:</p><p><em>a) Except for guns that fire more than one bullet with a single pull of the trigger, unless they were made before a certain date and you pay a license fee.</em></p><p><em>b) Except for guns that have more than some number of rounds of ammunition in the magazine.</em></p><p><em>c) Except for guns that have some undesirable physical characteristic, such as looking scary, rifles or shotguns with a barrel shorter than some dimension, or similar.</em></p><p><em>d) Except for guns that fire a projectile larger than (X), or having characteristics of (X) (e.g. armor-piercing ammo, etc)</em></p><p><em>e) Except for guns that have been made quieter by the addition of a sound-suppressing device, unless you pay a license fee for same and the local sheriff thinks you're nice.</em></p><p><em>f) Except if you don't have a permit to (buy|carry openly|carry concealed) or otherwise "bear" same.</em></p><p><em>g) Except if you'd like to buy and take it with you right now (e.g. "waiting period" laws.)</em></p><p><em>h) Except for rocket launchers.</em></p><p><em>i) Except for surface-to-air missiles.</em></p><p><em>j) Except for nuclear arms.</em></p><p>Now wait a second, you say! &nbsp;Those last three are bullcrap in private hands!</p><p>Maybe. &nbsp;But if so there is a way to make them unlawful within the Constitution --&nbsp;<strong>pass an Amendment. &nbsp;</strong>Absent that, ownership of any of the above&nbsp;<strong>and the carrying of any of the above, without any sort of permit,&nbsp;</strong>is lawful.</p><p>Unwise? &nbsp;Maybe. &nbsp;And immaterial. &nbsp;It's lawful and any law that says otherwise is&nbsp;<strong>unconstitutional.</strong></p><p>Don't even get me started on the Tenth Amendment.</p><p>I further challenge you to find&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>anywhere</strong></span> in the Constitution where the United States Supreme Court, or&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>any</strong></span> court for that matter, is empowered to re-write or as they like to say,&nbsp;<strong><em>interpret</em></strong> the plain language of said Constitution. &nbsp;</p><p>This is the sum total of what is said on same in The Constitution:</p><blockquote><p>Section 1.<br />The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour, and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office.</p><p>Section 2.<br /><strong>The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority</strong>;--to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--<strong>to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to controversies between two or more states;--between a state and citizens of another state;--between citizens of different states;--between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.</strong></p><p>In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and under such regulations as the Congress shall make.</p><p>The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.</p></blockquote><p>So where in there do you find there the power to rip up and rewrite said Constitution?</p><p>It's not there, and it never was.</p><p>Where there is legitimate debate over statutory construction let's have it, and let's have it there in the Supreme Court. &nbsp;But there is no debate of legitimacy over construction of the 2nd or 4th Amendments. &nbsp;There are&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>excuses</strong></span> for adding clauses that never existed&nbsp;<em><strong>and still don't</strong></em>, but they're flatly unlawful irrespective of who pronounces otherwise. &nbsp;Those who claim that technology or other changes in life have made the world a different place have a means to address their concern:&nbsp;<strong>Pass an Amendment.</strong></p><p>Instead what has happened in the "real world" we live in is that the government will find some thing they wish to do. &nbsp;They know it's unconstitutional but they do it anyway. &nbsp;Someone sues, after 5 or 10 years it makes its way to the Supreme Court and the government has in the meantime done its level best to stack the court with judges that will rule as it wishes. &nbsp;<strong>There is no law if the courts simply ignore what's in front of them, as occurred with Obamacare where the majority opinion ruled that a statute that was explicitly constructed not to be a tax was in fact a tax <span style="text-decoration: underline;">but the imposition of such a direct tax is barred from the Federal Government except in proportion to population</span></strong>. &nbsp;In other words you can be (directly) taxed&nbsp;<em><strong>but not in a different amount than someone else.</strong></em> &nbsp;This is why the 16th Amendment was necessary; to lay a tax on someone's work in proportion to what they&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>made</strong></span> was unconstitutional.</p><p>All of this game-playing in the judiciary rests on the thinnest of foundation; so-called&nbsp;<em>judicial comity</em>&nbsp;and <em>stare decisis</em>.<em> &nbsp;</em>That is, the premise that once a decision is made <strong>even if blatantly unconstitutional,&nbsp;</strong>it is thereafter the foundation of&nbsp;<em>everything</em> that follows and reciprocity and recognition is owed against that (blatantly unlawful) decision.</p><p><strong>You can't fix this with a ConCon or with "more Amendments" because they are subject to the same "interpretation" as has been all of the previous; the only solution is to&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">unwind</span> the previous violence done to the Constitution&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">and then</span>, if appropriate, pass Amendments that further constrain the rights protected by and powers delegated therein.</strong></p><p>Those who argue otherwise are fools, and those who refuse to take up the underlying issue and address it head-on are playing with you and are attempting to get you to expend your resources on a&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>false</strong></span> premise to thereby consume your efforts rather than solving the problem.</p><p>You can interest me in a ConCon when the&nbsp;First, Second, Fourth and Fifth Amendments are&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>enforced as written</strong></span> -- not one second before.</p><p>The right place to enforce this is in fact the States. &nbsp;If the States will not do so, then the people have to decide whether we are&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>50 states</strong></span> or factually&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>one state</strong></span> with 50 names.</p><p>You choose but don't blow smoke up my ass with this garbage about a "ConCon" fixing anything&nbsp;<strong>because it won't.</strong></p>

<div class="message">I think the 50 states are the key, Karl - we have to re-grant them the powers they had in prior years, if we expect them to step up.   They have no power now.   The federal concept ended with amendment 17, and handouts began just 10 years later.  handouts buy votes, like this article clearly says:<br><br>"Anti-abortion black ministers to endorse Obama&#039;s healthcare plan"<br><br><a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/24/nation/na-healthcare-pastors24" target="_blank">http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/24/....</a><br><br>Not in favor of illegal abortion, this just shows how morality silence can be bought.  <br><br>You are totally correct, simply introducing a new law will not help, the old ones are routinely disregarded.<br><br>People have ALWAYS tried to work around law - it is natural.  The Framer&#039;s brilliance was not just 3 branches (and a senate), it was realizing ALL HUMANS will try to abrogate law, and they tried to constrain powers by letting each branch work against the other.  <br><br>The SCOTUS and executive branch figured out how to abrogate it.   It is now a failed system of law.   It will remain a failure until we implement law that FORCES the supreme court to interpret law strictly by the original intent.  <br><br>- Abolish amendment 17:  This has not immediate effect, but long term will decentralize power.<br><br>- Grant governors the right to remove a justice by majority vote.<br><br>- The Supreme Court can review laws for constitutionality or<br>unconstitutionality based only on legislators original intent<br>indicated by collateral and coincidental related writing, floor<br>debate, speeches, and behaviors of those who drafted the<br>legislation. All powers are limited to this simple rendering<br>of opinionconstitutional or unconstitutional.<br><br>The key is we MUST reign in the SCOTUS - there is a reason democrats are stacking the courts with sotamayer&#039;s etc.   <br><br><br> </div>

<div class="message">The only way to force the USSC to follow the Constitution as written is to refuse to enforce it as they have butchered it.<br><br>You can&#039;t "reign in" the USSC by asking them to abrogate a throne that was never theirs, as they have before (and will again) refuse.<br><br>You can only compel them to do so, and the peaceful means by which you do so is at the State level.<br><br>The reason is this: The original intent of Federalism was to have a (generally) weak federal government and 50 state governments, all of which were political laboratories.

The only time the Constitution is actually followed now is when it MAY be CONVENIENT for someone&#039;s political agenda. <br><br>What always drives me nuts is how certain judges and politicians have a way of reading something in it that&#039;s CLEARLY NOT THERE, and sometimes IGNORING what IS there, just to make it square with their ideologies. <br><br>For example, many judges have ruled that the 2nd Amendment doesn&#039;t apply to individuals, when it CLEARLY states "The People". Also, the 1st Amendment says NOTHING about a "separation of church and state", but MANY judges and politicians act as if it does.</div>

You can have a Constitutional Convention but think about those who will be going to such a convention and what would finally be written.

Filled with all manner of political Correctness, much more of a Socialist State bent like the EU and probably even more expansion of the Police State than we have now. <br>I like Mark Levin but once you put something like this in motion every color of the political spectrum will come out of the wood work. </div>

<div class="message">One of the few cases that Luther Martin lost was McCulloch v. Maryland.  Martin had been at the Constitutional Convention, where chief justice (sic) Marshall had not.  Martin told him in court that if Marshall&#039;s interpretation of the Constitution had been mentioned during the ratification conventions, the Constitution would never have been adopted.  <br><br>I think that we would have been far better off if John Dickinson&#039;s original draft of the Articles of Confederation had been adopted, instead of the watered down version.  That would have made the Constitutional Convention unnecessary.  <br><br>It is arguable that the Constitution was never intended to establish a republic, but rather to perpetuate the prevailing oligarchy.  Even so, as my friend the late Joseph Sobran sadly said, "The Constitution isn&#039;t perfect, but it is better than what we have now."</div>

<div class="message">I read the previous discussions but had little time to comment. I came to the same conclusion. What good does it do to rewrite something when the basic problem is that it is not being followed to start? The problem is not the document - it is with the enforcement/recognition of the document.<br><br>If the aim of a CC is simply to place penalties for the  "or else" capability for violation of Constitutional laws/amendments  those powers are already there. Good luck in getting the makers of the problems to be the solver of problems.<br><br>Even the Revolutionary War was sparked by such behaviors. Documents and laws existed but were ignored when it came to the American Colonists. The taxation without representation and various financial thefts and abrogation of freedoms as British subjects heaped upon the Colonists eventually led to war.<br><br>Same problems today but a different time with different players but the same attitudes.<br><br>The problems is that states are now seen as subservient to the federal government when that government was intended to be the servant of the states especially to aid interstate commerce.  This perversion and centralization of power was something to be avoided. How many people today embrace this corruption?<br><br>How many states are now dependent upon wealth reallocation from productive states by the federal system to their own coffers-especially within the major cities. Lap dogs never survive without their masters. <br><br>CC is simply another method to distract and pervert the rule of natural laws. It is a pipe dream with the current "political" classes that are running the country. Does anybody really think they have anyone else&#039;s interest but their own at the heart of this matter?<br><br><br><br></div>

<div class="message">I&#039;m only going to talk to the objections raised here, I&#039;m not here to represent my will or my opinion, only facts of support and disagreement.  <br><br>Can we try to discuss this objectively based on merits or conflicts?  Free of vitriol - like the founders exhibited in Philadelphia?  Their dialogue was particularly focused on evaluating changes of law based on how humans, humans prone to avarice, would behave under the law, not on who was stupid or who would win the most.  What has actually worked and not worked?<br><br>For instance, we now clearly see Stare decisis is our enemy.  It has manifested avarice, abuse, abrogation of written law.  It is a cancer.<br><br>The founders were all about controlling avarice of politicians using CLEVER LAWS pitting one politician power against anothers&#039; avarice.  Why not find an amendment to end stare decisis?<br>--------------------<br>Objections:<br><br>1.  "once you put something like this in motion every color of the political spectrum will come out of the wood work."<br>2.  "It&#039;s a complete waste of time to write words on paper if they&#039;re ignored"<br><br>Addressing item 1:  <br>Each state gets one vote.  If the constructionists sense the process is hijacked by the liberals they&#039;ll abandon it.   We have to count on 2/3 of the states (38) being fed up enough to say enough if enough, and the present fiscal fraud scheme and rights abusing central government is no longer serving the best interests.  There should be enough constructionist in 30-40 states to get that moving.  Remember the folks in the revolution of the US were are minority - a forceful minority.  <br><br>From my contacts thus far, the COS Project seems well focused on REDUCING FEDERAL POWERS.   No talk of new abortion law or new "rights" - just returning to what worked well.  It is not a group pushing consensus and lets all do what is popular.  They aim to reign in the federal gov&#039;t - including entitlements.  <br><br>Will it be perfect?  No.  Neither was the Constitution.   <br><br>Addressing Item 2:<br>Karl you are 100% - 1000 PERCENT right.  New amendments will be disregarded BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.   <br><br>But new amendments won&#039;t necessarily be disregarded by STATE governments.  State governments have been emasculated by the Federal government through coercive benefits handouts.  We have to end that coercions to get our individual rights back.  Our states rights, our 50 economic engines trying different formulae.       <br><br>There has to be a POWER WIN in at least one amendment, a win that delegates new power to the state politicians.   <br><br>My sense is that if we give governors the powers to remove justices, they will serially remove each justice who is working against their selfish powers.  <br><br>Maybe we need MORE than a rule to remove justices.  More state powers over federal misbehavior.   There is no win for a governor to speak up now - the federal government can just withhold benefits to that states&#039; voters.  <br><br>-----------------------<br>Lastly - It is a common observation that leaving the existing motivations in place will result in the same behavior.   <br><br>We have to change something, and I&#039;m not in favor of a revolution or secession yet.  <br><br>We have in article 5 a means to bypass Washington built into the Constitution.     <br><br>Why not try to create new distributed powers that handcuff the SCOTUS IMMEDIATELY and REWARD bold state leaders that do so with new powers they don&#039;t have now?    <br></div>

<div class="message">The commerce clause is another one that has been thoroughly abused to enable the Federal Government to meddle in affairs that are supposed to be left to the States. This has been going on for at least 70 years, perhaps starting with the convoluted reasoning of the SCOTUS in Wickard V. Filburn in 1942. I think this is also how they enforced civil rights laws against southern restaurants in the 1960s. There is little or no regard for either the Constitution or laws in general (e.g. banker fraud) by the Federal Government. Until they stop being regarded as more than suggestions to be employed selectively at their discretion, any further words written down on paper or electronic media would be meaningless.</div>

<div class="message">What Karl is proposing is not all that far fetched.  Jefferson, in the Kentucky Resolutions, said that states had the right to nullify unconstitutional laws within their boundaries.  The real federal coup was when Marshall pulled his fast one in Marbury v. Madison, a case he should have recused himself from, and usurped the power of judicial review.  As for nullification, the State of Wisconsin nullified the Fugitive Slave Act, and pretty much got away with that.  </div>

Even voting to take property in the form of taxes is nothing more than one group stealing the property of another.  <br><br>Without the bill of rights, the Constitution wouldn&#039;t have passed, because the people knew it was drawn up by a bunch of bankers and land speculators that wanted to feather their own nests.  It was the distribution of power and property that made the USA what it was.  We have a royalty in the US, though they are unseen.  They run us from one war to the next.  They run a system that protects the bankers while exposing the masses to loss.  When the stuff hits the fan, you at best have the right to move your money from one bank to the next, but not to withdraw over a minimal amount of it.  Then we have the bureaucracy, which itself is stripping the private sector of its power and property.  It is not by chance that the richest counties in the US abut Washington DC.  If you are going to do anything but exist, you need lawyers to function.  It isn&#039;t the rich that are stripping the middle class, but the connected.  The takings clause in the 5th was meant to mean more than they tell us it does today.  </div>

<div class="message">Sorry for the length of this, but the evidence pile of democracy - our current government practice since amendment 17 was created - paints a tragic future for us, we will never vote our way out of this.   <br><br>The current behavior of the US government is entirely consistent with Democracy&#039;s wretched history.   Democracy is our illness, not the people running it. People are ALWAYS selfish and short sighted on the whole.   And democracy ALWAYS manifests humans worst mob rule behavior.     <br><br>Democracy has NEVER worked.  Let&#039;s look at the history on this form of government, a history which predicts CLEARLY what we are seeing now.<br><br>The majority simply votes to take the minority&#039;s belongings, and Polybius says they go mad and violent, both of which we are seeing in abundance now with the liberal constituency.  Even the Republican party is a liberal party now, humans&#039; greed cannot resist the false promise of gov&#039;t handouts "fixing" things. <br><br>We have to cease being a democracy - somehow - if we hope to restore our rule of laws.   The mob of voters is not going to become sane - they are going to get far far worse, if you believe what history tells us.<br><br>Let&#039;s look at the history:<br>--------------------<br>Polybius observed the people become senseless and bribed by the politicians&#039; handouts, exactly as we see now, vote buying on a massive scale and constant claims of "doing good" with every new abrogating of written law:<br><br>"By which means when, in their senseless mania for reputation, they have made the populace ready and greedy to receive bribes, the virtue of democracy is destroyed, and it is transformed into a government of violence and the strong hand."  <br>------------------------<br>Plato described the madness using a ship analogy, again this seems spot on describing the US the last 40 years, not the :<br>" Imagine then a ship or a fleet in which there is a captain who is taller and stronger than any of the crew, but who is a little deaf and has a similar infirmity in sight, and whose knowledge of navigation is not much better. The sailors are quarreling with one another about the steeringevery one is of the opinion that he has a right to steer, though he has never learned the art of navigation."<br><br>"[The sailors] throng about the captain, begging and praying him to commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them overboard, and having first chained up the noble captains senses with drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the ship and make free with the stores, thus eating and drinking"<br><br>"In their ignorance they tend to vote for politicians who beguile them with appearances and nebulous talk" . (Note: Plato did not say the voters were ignorant, he said they display ignorance)<br>-------------------------<br>The founders never once wanted a democracy - they feared democracy, it was a known, failed form of government in their time as well.<br>----------------------<br>The founders feared handouts being a federal power - I can&#039;t find it mentioned or considered anywhere in their writings.  It was a known, persistently failing government power in their time as well.  Numerous quotes exist of Early US leaders citing that congress does not have the power to hand out money to the people.  <br>----------------------<br>Democracy leads to communism - Lenin considered it ESSENTIAL to socialism, the path to communism:<br><br>Democracy is indispensable to socialism.        -Vladimir Lenin<br>-----------------------<br>We are now communist in tens of ways: <br><br>They&#039;re marching with communists,<br>attending funerals of dead communist heros (Mandela), <br>socializing with communists, <br>protesting with communists, <br>being admired by communists, <br>joined as an allied party with communists, <br>creating special rights like communists, <br>spying on your phone calls like communists, <br>bullying corporations into spying on you like communists, <br>removing the rights of our opposition like communists, <br>taking taxes from each according to ability like communists, <br>handing benefits to they&#039;re supporters like communists, <br>allowing corruption like communists, <br>blaming new failures on prior, fake conservative leaders like communists, <br>using the Supreme Court as a edict-creating, politburo;  like communists, <br>restricting religious expression like communists, <br>and aligning gov&#039;t agencies against their opponents like communists, <br><br><a href="http://www.keywiki.org/index.php/Barack_Obama_and_the_Communist_Party" target="_blank">http://www.keywiki.org/index.php/Barack_....</a><br>Endorsement from CPUSA for last election:<br><a href="http://www.cpusa.org/why-vote/" target="_blank">http://www.cpusa.org/why-vote/</a><br>Democrats marching with communists in LA:<br><a href="http://topconservativenews.com/2011/05/massive-communist-parade-held-in-los-angeles-for-may-day/" target="_blank">http://topconservativenews.com/2011/05/m....</a><br>Democrats organizing with communists:<br><a href="http://www.lookingattheleft.com/2010/10/democrats-union-workers-and-communists-rally-together-in-washington/" target="_blank">http://www.lookingattheleft.com/2010/10/....</a>   (pictures)<br><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/09/obamas_communist_party_endorsement.html#ixzz2RwspwY00" target="_blank">http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/09/o....</a><br><a href="http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/10/progressives_and_communists_ou_1.html" target="_blank">http://www.americanthinker.com/2010/10/p....</a><br>DHS goes ONLY to IRS protests, not 99%<br>https://www.google.com/url?sa=f&amp;rct=j&amp;url=<a href="http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/05/21/why-were-dhs-agents-seemingly-monitoring-multiple-tea-party-irs-protests-across-the-country-on-tuesday/&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;ei=y4vBUfbBMo3k8gSHo4HADA&amp;usg=AFQjCNGtMeDyO8zpwUOdSbU9d3CTzlNdeA" target="_blank">http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2013/05/....</a><br><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/02/homeland-security-occupy-wall-street_n_3002445.html" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/04/02....</a><br><br><br></div>
