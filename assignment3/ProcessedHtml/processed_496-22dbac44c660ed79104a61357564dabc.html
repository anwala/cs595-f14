     * [116]Pailon del Diablo Waterfall, Ecuador At first it’s lovely to
       notice that the staircase adjacent to these waterfalls was designed
       to blend in with the tropical landscape. But consider the name—in
       English, the Devil’s Cauldron—and the evil tricks the steep steps
       can play. They are made of smooth, oversize pebbles that provide
       little traction, and when you're looking down, they blend together,
       creating an optical illusion of a stone slide. They’re also
       slippery from the constant mist from the falls and even though
       there’s a metal railing to save you from any spills—but don’t count
       on that too much—it too is drenched with water droplets.
