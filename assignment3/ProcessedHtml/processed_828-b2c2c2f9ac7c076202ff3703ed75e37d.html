   Clemsoning

   Ty and Dan discuss Florida State’s overtime win without Winston,
   Oregon’s near-miss with Washington State, Mississippi State’s
   domination of LSU, Alabama’s offense, and Michigan’s continued decline.
   Plus, Oklahoma’s impressive ground attack, Tim Beckman’s drive for six
   wins, and the official ruling on Saturday night’s quasi-Clemsoning.

   NEWS

   The guys have pretty big news at the end of the show that you’ll have
   to listen to to find out.

   GAME RECAPS

   ACC

   Florida State 23, Clemson 17: Dan and Ty were impressed with Clemson
   backup QB, Deshaun Watson’s performance Saturday. They were not as
   impressed with Florida State’s counterpart, Sean Maguire, but he was
   just good enough to win. They also, of course, discuss if the game
   could be deemed a “Clemson-ing,” as many claimed on Twitter, making it
   a trending topic.

   Nebraska 41, Miami 31: Ty was astounded that the polite folks of
   Nebraska [25]boo’d Miami as it left the field. [26]Ameer Abdullah was a
   workhorse for the Cornhuskers, carrying the ball 35 times, which Dan
   found to be worrisome, but says it was still a nice win.

   BYU 41, Virginia 33: Dan just wants to mention that [27]Taysom Hill is
   really, really good. Ty adds that Hill will likely get to New York for
   the Heisman ceremony.

   PAC-12

   Oregon 38, Washington State 31: Dan says if Oregon wants to be
   considered a perennial top-5 team, it needs to be able to sustain
   injuries, and they didn’t play like they could on Saturday. Dan also
   criticizes Oregon’s defensive scheme of sitting back in zone and not
   get pressure on Washington State’s Connor Halladay. But Marcus Mariota
   was still prolific for the Ducks to escape Pullman.

   Arizona 49, Cal 45: Ty wants half-credit for his prediction of an
   out-right Cal win because Arizona won on a [28]Hail Mary. Dan points
   out that it’s hard to play defense for a full game with a team only has
   a starting 11 and not much else. He also said Cal ran the ball well and
   was impressed with that. Ty is still not sold on Anu Solomon, but was
   impressed with his 520-yard passing performance against Cal.

   SEC

   Mississippi State 34, LSU 29: Ty was caught off guard by how much the
   Bulldogs dominated the game, with the final score not representative of
   how the game went. He said it’s informative that LSU was unable to run
   the ball, even with the talent it has in the backfield. Dan liked the
   way Mississippi State QB Dak Prescott played in Death Valley at night
   against a good LSU defense. On the flip side, LSU’s QB, Anthony
   Jennings, was horrendous. It was a flat performance from the Tigers.

   Alabama 42, Florida 21: Alabama racked up 645 yards on offense as Blake
   Sims was brilliant for the Tide, Ty said, while proclaiming that the
   Gators’ offense was still a [29]tire fire. Dan puts the final nail in
   Jeff Driskel’s average coffin. Dan also says that Amari Cooper is the
   best wide receiver in the nation, by a long shot.

   Auburn 20, K-State 14: Ty says it was a very, very weird game, but
   wasn’t surprised it was so close as K-State sold out on the Tigers’
   run, and Auburn could not take advantage. Dan appreciated K-State’s
   defensive game plan, noting its discipline and ability to tackle in
   space. Ty laments K-State’s many, many mistakes in what was a game the
   Wildcats should have won.

   Indiania 31, Missouri 27: Ty says that this is a borderline
   “Clemson-ing.” Dan agrees as Mizzou raised expectations last year and
   then continued to win early this season only to lose to Indiana, which
   lost to Bowling Green the week before.

   BIG 12

   Oklahoma 45, West Virginia 33: The two stories from this game that
   stood out to Ty were: 1. Oklahoma true freshman running back[30] Samaje
   Perine, who ran for 242 yards and four touchdowns against the
   Mountaineers; and 2. West Virginia’s offense is clearly the real
   deal.They’re both impressed with Zach Sanchez.

   BIG 10

   Utah 26, Michigan 10: Even after expecting the Utes to win, Ty is still
   surprised at how bad the loss was for the Wolverines. He believes it
   might be the final end to the Brady Hoke era in Ann Arbor. Dan does not
   want to overlook how Utah played while piling onto Michigan. Ty is
   curious how bad it could get for Michigan.

   Wisconsin 68, Bowling Green 17: Melvin “Melgor” Gordon had a big day
   for the Badgers with 253 yards rushing and five TDs on just 13 carries.
   Dan points out that Tanner McEvoy still is not great, though.

   PATRIOT LEAGUE LIGHTING ROUND:

   Harvard 41, Holy Cross 18: The “Crossaders” were blasted by the Ivy
   Leagues representatives.

   Georgetown 17, Brown 3: The Bulldogs of Georgetown have to much defense
   for the Brown “Brown Bears,” Dan says.

   Colgate 27, Cornell 12

   Bucknell 36, Sacred Heart 20: The Bison defied all odds and went into
   the “Heartdome,” or “The Corazon” and came out with a win.

   William & Mary 33, Lafayette 19: Bill & Mary use a second half comeback
   to stun Lafayette.

   Yale 54, LeHigh 43: Handsome Dan takes it to Ugly LeHigh.

   Fordham 49, Columbia 7: New York’s official team establishes its
   dominance in the Big Apple once again.
