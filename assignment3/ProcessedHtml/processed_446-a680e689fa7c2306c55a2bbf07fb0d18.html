   Wow! Now you've got a really tough job, and one that is so important to
   our restaurant. We are all about serving our awesome food quickly, and
   doing it with warm and friendly people. You are the lucky person who is
   tasked with delivering this experience to our drive thru guests.
   We know it's not easy to be "warm and friendly" through a headset, but
   that is the challenge we've given you. Your role is even more
   challenging because you serve as both the server and cashier, so while
   you're taking one guest's order, you're also taking payment from
   another guest, or giving them their food, all at the same time. Oh, one
   more thing: we'd love it if you can do that quickly so that our guests
   can get home or wherever they are headed as soon as possible.
   Yes, we know that we've given you one of the most difficult roles in
   the restaurant, but we also know you can do it!! Just remember that you
   are the only "touch point" for our drive thru guests so it's important
   that you ensure that they experience the same level of hospitality and
   service that our dine‐in guests experience (we've given you the
   in‐store server and cashier roles so that you understand exactly what
   this means).
   You'll achieve success if you are able to help our guests with any
   questions they may have about our menu when they are placing their
   orders, and then at the window, deliver them a warm smile and sincere
   "thank you" for visiting us.
   Lastly, because they are drive thru guests, they may not realize that a
   lot has changed inside the restaurant. Use your interaction with our
   guests at the window to let them know that something is different
   inside, and invite them to give us a try dining in the next time they
   come to Boston Market.
