   The Craziness Of A ConCon

   [akcs-www?get_gallerynr=3904]

   I keep getting asked about this and people keep advocating it, so let's
   talk about it.

   The issue is a Constitutional Convention, with the expressed intent
   being to return the United States to its Constitutional Roots.

   Sounds like a good idea, yes?

   Well, it quite arguably is, if you'd like to see the government return
   to its Constitutional boundaries.

   The problem is that this "remedy" isn't a remedy and if it comes to
   pass what you want won't happen.

   I know this for a fact and, if you think about it, so do you.

   I know what you're going to say: How can you be so sure?

   It's simple: There is nothing wrong with the Constitution as it sits
   now.  The problem is that it's not followed.

   Let's just take one example: The Fourth Amendment

   It reads:

     Amendment IV
     The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses,
     papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures,
     shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon
     probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly
     describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be
     seized.

   It does not say:

   a) Except when a police officer wants to stop and frisk you.

   b) Except when the government thinks you might be a terrorist.

   c) Except when someone else has your "papers" because you had to let
   them have same as an essential part of buying a service from them (e.g.
   your cell phone "tower" records.)

   d) Except when you're driving while black.

   e) Except when you're driving anywhere, at all, and the government
   thinks you might have drug money in the car but has no probable cause
   to believe so.

   And on and on and on.

   It says shall not be violated, and it further mandates that a warrant
   may only issue predicated on probable cause, supported by oath or
   affirmation (not the unsworn word of an unnamed "confidential
   informant" nor can a dog "swear an oath") and that the particular place
   to be searched and the persons or things to be seized must be named.
   That latter requirement is there so the cops can't go on fishing
   expeditions.

   Let's try another one:

     Amendment II
     A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free
     state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be
     infringed.

   It does not say:

   a) Except for guns that fire more than one bullet with a single pull of
   the trigger, unless they were made before a certain date and you pay a
   license fee.

   b) Except for guns that have more than some number of rounds of
   ammunition in the magazine.

   c) Except for guns that have some undesirable physical characteristic,
   such as looking scary, rifles or shotguns with a barrel shorter than
   some dimension, or similar.

   d) Except for guns that fire a projectile larger than (X), or having
   characteristics of (X) (e.g. armor-piercing ammo, etc)

   e) Except for guns that have been made quieter by the addition of a
   sound-suppressing device, unless you pay a license fee for same and the
   local sheriff thinks you're nice.

   f) Except if you don't have a permit to (buy|carry openly|carry
   concealed) or otherwise "bear" same.

   g) Except if you'd like to buy and take it with you right now (e.g.
   "waiting period" laws.)

   h) Except for rocket launchers.

   i) Except for surface-to-air missiles.

   j) Except for nuclear arms.

   Now wait a second, you say!  Those last three are bullcrap in private
   hands!

   Maybe.  But if so there is a way to make them unlawful within the
   Constitution -- pass an Amendment.  Absent that, ownership of any of
   the above and the carrying of any of the above, without any sort of
   permit, is lawful.

   Unwise?  Maybe.  And immaterial.  It's lawful and any law that says
   otherwise is unconstitutional.

   Don't even get me started on the Tenth Amendment.

   I further challenge you to find anywhere in the Constitution where the
   United States Supreme Court, or any court for that matter, is empowered
   to re-write or as they like to say, interpret the plain language of
   said Constitution.

   This is the sum total of what is said on same in The Constitution:

     Section 1.
     The judicial power of the United States, shall be vested in one
     Supreme Court, and in such inferior courts as the Congress may from
     time to time ordain and establish. The judges, both of the supreme
     and inferior courts, shall hold their offices during good behaviour,
     and shall, at stated times, receive for their services, a
     compensation, which shall not be diminished during their continuance
     in office.

     Section 2.
     The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity,
     arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and
     treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;--to
     all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and
     consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--to
     controversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to
     controversies between two or more states;--between a state and
     citizens of another state;--between citizens of different
     states;--between citizens of the same state claiming lands under
     grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens
     thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.

     In all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and
     consuls, and those in which a state shall be party, the Supreme
     Court shall have original jurisdiction. In all the other cases
     before mentioned, the Supreme Court shall have appellate
     jurisdiction, both as to law and fact, with such exceptions, and
     under such regulations as the Congress shall make.

     The trial of all crimes, except in cases of impeachment, shall be by
     jury; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said
     crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any
     state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress
     may by law have directed.

   So where in there do you find there the power to rip up and rewrite
   said Constitution?

   It's not there, and it never was.

   Where there is legitimate debate over statutory construction let's have
   it, and let's have it there in the Supreme Court.  But there is no
   debate of legitimacy over construction of the 2nd or 4th Amendments.
   There are excuses for adding clauses that never existed and still
   don't, but they're flatly unlawful irrespective of who pronounces
   otherwise.  Those who claim that technology or other changes in life
   have made the world a different place have a means to address their
   concern: Pass an Amendment.

   Instead what has happened in the "real world" we live in is that the
   government will find some thing they wish to do.  They know it's
   unconstitutional but they do it anyway.  Someone sues, after 5 or 10
   years it makes its way to the Supreme Court and the government has in
   the meantime done its level best to stack the court with judges that
   will rule as it wishes.  There is no law if the courts simply ignore
   what's in front of them, as occurred with Obamacare where the majority
   opinion ruled that a statute that was explicitly constructed not to be
   a tax was in fact a tax but the imposition of such a direct tax is
   barred from the Federal Government except in proportion to population.
    In other words you can be (directly) taxed but not in a different
   amount than someone else.  This is why the 16th Amendment was
   necessary; to lay a tax on someone's work in proportion to what
   they made was unconstitutional.

   All of this game-playing in the judiciary rests on the thinnest of
   foundation; so-called judicial comity and stare decisis.  That is, the
   premise that once a decision is made even if blatantly
   unconstitutional, it is thereafter the foundation of everything that
   follows and reciprocity and recognition is owed against that (blatantly
   unlawful) decision.

   You can't fix this with a ConCon or with "more Amendments" because they
   are subject to the same "interpretation" as has been all of the
   previous; the only solution is to unwind the previous violence done to
   the Constitution and then, if appropriate, pass Amendments that further
   constrain the rights protected by and powers delegated therein.

   Those who argue otherwise are fools, and those who refuse to take up
   the underlying issue and address it head-on are playing with you and
   are attempting to get you to expend your resources on a false premise
   to thereby consume your efforts rather than solving the problem.

   You can interest me in a ConCon when the First, Second, Fourth and
   Fifth Amendments are enforced as written -- not one second before.

   The right place to enforce this is in fact the States.  If the States
   will not do so, then the people have to decide whether we are 50 states
   or factually one state with 50 names.

   You choose but don't blow smoke up my ass with this garbage about a
   "ConCon" fixing anything because it won't.

   I think the 50 states are the key, Karl - we have to re-grant them the
   powers they had in prior years, if we expect them to step up. They have
   no power now. The federal concept ended with amendment 17, and handouts
   began just 10 years later. handouts buy votes, like this article
   clearly says:
   "Anti-abortion black ministers to endorse Obama's healthcare plan"
   [28]http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/24/....
   Not in favor of illegal abortion, this just shows how morality silence
   can be bought.
   You are totally correct, simply introducing a new law will not help,
   the old ones are routinely disregarded.
   People have ALWAYS tried to work around law - it is natural. The
   Framer's brilliance was not just 3 branches (and a senate), it was
   realizing ALL HUMANS will try to abrogate law, and they tried to
   constrain powers by letting each branch work against the other.
   The SCOTUS and executive branch figured out how to abrogate it. It is
   now a failed system of law. It will remain a failure until we implement
   law that FORCES the supreme court to interpret law strictly by the
   original intent.
   - Abolish amendment 17: This has not immediate effect, but long term
   will decentralize power.
   - Grant governors the right to remove a justice by majority vote.
   - The Supreme Court can review laws for constitutionality or
   unconstitutionality based only on legislators original intent
   indicated by collateral and coincidental related writing, floor
   debate, speeches, and behaviors of those who drafted the
   legislation. All powers are limited to this simple rendering
   of opinionconstitutional or unconstitutional.
   The key is we MUST reign in the SCOTUS - there is a reason democrats
   are stacking the courts with sotamayer's etc.

   The only way to force the USSC to follow the Constitution as written is
   to refuse to enforce it as they have butchered it.
   You can't "reign in" the USSC by asking them to abrogate a throne that
   was never theirs, as they have before (and will again) refuse.
   You can only compel them to do so, and the peaceful means by which you
   do so is at the State level.
   The reason is this: The original intent of Federalism was to have a
   (generally) weak federal government and 50 state governments, all of
   which were political laboratories. Those that were more-successful
   would attract both people and commerce, those that were less would shed
   same. Over time this results in the good ideas being adopted and the
   bad ones discarded, all without anyone shooting anyone else.
   You can pass all the Amendments you wish but until you can explain to
   me why any of them would be followed any more than the 2nd or 5th have
   been, never mind the 4th, I'm not interested in jacking off in the
   passage of something that is a dead letter before it ever hits the
   desk.

   Stare decisis is an abomination. The effect of it is that with every
   decision the power of future jurists is diminished. Why is the wisdom
   and judgement of previous judges considered unimpeachable? Are current
   judges less qualified to render opinions than their predecessors?
   In the legislative arena this would be the equivalent of congress
   passing a law that future legislatures could not amend or abolish. That
   is not how things are supposed to work!

   The Republitards have been harping on this ever since Levin published
   his book on it. They're rabid over it. They simply refuse to see that
   they won't get the results they want. Not only will the new amendments
   not be followed, but any amendments they might get would not be good
   ones like they think. They want to open Pandora's box and hope they get
   good results.
   As you say Karl, the States will have to fix this by not listening to
   the SCOTUS or the Federal Govt. Personally, I think it'll take
   secession to fix this mess... too many people are on the dole to ever
   starve the beast or try to reign in the feds via the 10th.

   I don't think it necessarily takes secession but it does take one or
   more states that will stand up and refuse to cooperate with blatantly
   unconstitutional expressions of federal power, up to and including (if
   necessary) arresting and charging anyone trying to enforce same, along
   with potentially revoking the business charters for foreign
   (out-of-state domiciled, but operating within a given state)
   corporations.
   It's a complete waste of time to write words on paper if they're
   ignored; I'm interested in a debate on how or what to change in the
   Constitution when (and only when) the words that are already there mean
   something.

   All very well stated KD.
   They can do a Constitutional Convention every month, and pass all of
   the Amendments they like, but if they're going to be ignored by the
   courts and governments at every level(as is the case now), it will be
   meaningless. The only time the Constitution is actually followed now is
   when it MAY be CONVENIENT for someone's political agenda.
   What always drives me nuts is how certain judges and politicians have a
   way of reading something in it that's CLEARLY NOT THERE, and sometimes
   IGNORING what IS there, just to make it square with their ideologies.
   For example, many judges have ruled that the 2nd Amendment doesn't
   apply to individuals, when it CLEARLY states "The People". Also, the
   1st Amendment says NOTHING about a "separation of church and state",
   but MANY judges and politicians act as if it does.

   Keep in mind something else that hasn't been discussed much. You can
   have a Constitutional Convention but think about those who will be
   going to such a convention and what would finally be written. It would
   be a total abomination and the exact antithesis of what we have now.
   Filled with all manner of political Correctness, much more of a
   Socialist State bent like the EU and probably even more expansion of
   the Police State than we have now.
   I like Mark Levin but once you put something like this in motion every
   color of the political spectrum will come out of the wood work.

   One of the few cases that Luther Martin lost was McCulloch v. Maryland.
   Martin had been at the Constitutional Convention, where chief justice
   (sic) Marshall had not. Martin told him in court that if Marshall's
   interpretation of the Constitution had been mentioned during the
   ratification conventions, the Constitution would never have been
   adopted.
   I think that we would have been far better off if John Dickinson's
   original draft of the Articles of Confederation had been adopted,
   instead of the watered down version. That would have made the
   Constitutional Convention unnecessary.
   It is arguable that the Constitution was never intended to establish a
   republic, but rather to perpetuate the prevailing oligarchy. Even so,
   as my friend the late Joseph Sobran sadly said, "The Constitution isn't
   perfect, but it is better than what we have now."

   Statutory construction long predates the United States of America.
   The words "shall" and "shall not" are used in statutes for a very
   precise reason -- they are absolute barriers. This is one of the first
   things you learn when studying how statutes are written and to be
   construed.
   There is no legitimate argument to be had over those phrases, and
   anyone who so claims in a judicial context is by definition both
   abusing their office and violating its oath. It's really that simple.
   Until we actually enforce what's written down adding more words to a
   piece of paper is a waste of time.

   I thin the one productive thing a concon could do would be to
   explicitly state that all references to "person, persons, etc." in the
   Constitution refer to natural persons and not artificial persons called
   corporations. I can see that nullifying SCOTUS decisions about
   corporate money equating to their free speech right.

   I read the previous discussions but had little time to comment. I came
   to the same conclusion. What good does it do to rewrite something when
   the basic problem is that it is not being followed to start? The
   problem is not the document - it is with the enforcement/recognition of
   the document.
   If the aim of a CC is simply to place penalties for the "or else"
   capability for violation of Constitutional laws/amendments those powers
   are already there. Good luck in getting the makers of the problems to
   be the solver of problems.
   Even the Revolutionary War was sparked by such behaviors. Documents and
   laws existed but were ignored when it came to the American Colonists.
   The taxation without representation and various financial thefts and
   abrogation of freedoms as British subjects heaped upon the Colonists
   eventually led to war.
   Same problems today but a different time with different players but the
   same attitudes.
   The problems is that states are now seen as subservient to the federal
   government when that government was intended to be the servant of the
   states especially to aid interstate commerce. This perversion and
   centralization of power was something to be avoided. How many people
   today embrace this corruption?
   How many states are now dependent upon wealth reallocation from
   productive states by the federal system to their own coffers-especially
   within the major cities. Lap dogs never survive without their masters.
   CC is simply another method to distract and pervert the rule of natural
   laws. It is a pipe dream with the current "political" classes that are
   running the country. Does anybody really think they have anyone else's
   interest but their own at the heart of this matter?

   I'm only going to talk to the objections raised here, I'm not here to
   represent my will or my opinion, only facts of support and
   disagreement.
   Can we try to discuss this objectively based on merits or conflicts?
   Free of vitriol - like the founders exhibited in Philadelphia? Their
   dialogue was particularly focused on evaluating changes of law based on
   how humans, humans prone to avarice, would behave under the law, not on
   who was stupid or who would win the most. What has actually worked and
   not worked?
   For instance, we now clearly see Stare decisis is our enemy. It has
   manifested avarice, abuse, abrogation of written law. It is a cancer.
   The founders were all about controlling avarice of politicians using
   CLEVER LAWS pitting one politician power against anothers' avarice. Why
   not find an amendment to end stare decisis?
   --------------------
   Objections:
   1. "once you put something like this in motion every color of the
   political spectrum will come out of the wood work."
   2. "It's a complete waste of time to write words on paper if they're
   ignored"
   Addressing item 1:
   Each state gets one vote. If the constructionists sense the process is
   hijacked by the liberals they'll abandon it. We have to count on 2/3 of
   the states (38) being fed up enough to say enough if enough, and the
   present fiscal fraud scheme and rights abusing central government is no
   longer serving the best interests. There should be enough
   constructionist in 30-40 states to get that moving. Remember the folks
   in the revolution of the US were are minority - a forceful minority.
   From my contacts thus far, the COS Project seems well focused on
   REDUCING FEDERAL POWERS. No talk of new abortion law or new "rights" -
   just returning to what worked well. It is not a group pushing consensus
   and lets all do what is popular. They aim to reign in the federal gov't
   - including entitlements.
   Will it be perfect? No. Neither was the Constitution.
   Addressing Item 2:
   Karl you are 100% - 1000 PERCENT right. New amendments will be
   disregarded BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.
   But new amendments won't necessarily be disregarded by STATE
   governments. State governments have been emasculated by the Federal
   government through coercive benefits handouts. We have to end that
   coercions to get our individual rights back. Our states rights, our 50
   economic engines trying different formulae.
   There has to be a POWER WIN in at least one amendment, a win that
   delegates new power to the state politicians.
   My sense is that if we give governors the powers to remove justices,
   they will serially remove each justice who is working against their
   selfish powers.
   Maybe we need MORE than a rule to remove justices. More state powers
   over federal misbehavior. There is no win for a governor to speak up
   now - the federal government can just withhold benefits to that states'
   voters.
   -----------------------
   Lastly - It is a common observation that leaving the existing
   motivations in place will result in the same behavior.
   We have to change something, and I'm not in favor of a revolution or
   secession yet.
   We have in article 5 a means to bypass Washington built into the
   Constitution.
   Why not try to create new distributed powers that handcuff the SCOTUS
   IMMEDIATELY and REWARD bold state leaders that do so with new powers
   they don't have now?

   Because it will be disregarded just as all the other Amendments have
   been.
   Either man up or shut up. Do not ask me to do once again that which has
   already been done and disregarded without consequence.

   The commerce clause is another one that has been thoroughly abused to
   enable the Federal Government to meddle in affairs that are supposed to
   be left to the States. This has been going on for at least 70 years,
   perhaps starting with the convoluted reasoning of the SCOTUS in Wickard
   V. Filburn in 1942. I think this is also how they enforced civil rights
   laws against southern restaurants in the 1960s. There is little or no
   regard for either the Constitution or laws in general (e.g. banker
   fraud) by the Federal Government. Until they stop being regarded as
   more than suggestions to be employed selectively at their discretion,
   any further words written down on paper or electronic media would be
   meaningless.

   I've been waiting for you to write this one. You are exactly right, no
   amount of amendments will fix anything if we don't follow them and
   there is no reason to believe that we would.
   I've been saying for some time now that the USSC screwed us and screwed
   us well. They betrayed the country. There expressed reason for
   existence is what you have above:

Quote:

     Section 2.
     The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity,
     arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and
     treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;--to
     all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and
     consuls;--to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;--to
     controversies to which the United States shall be a party;--to
     controversies between two or more states;--between a state and
     citizens of another state;--between citizens of different
     states;--between citizens of the same state claiming lands under
     grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens
     thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects.

   A blatant example of their betrayal of the country was in Massachusetts
   vs Mellon in which they basically said, we are throwing the 10th
   Amendment out of the constitution by not letting anyone (or state) have
   standing to bring a suit under that amendment.
   Flap
   P.S. "Shall" and "shall not" is about as clear as you can get in the
   English language.
   ----------
   Here are my predictions for everyone to see:
   S&P 500 at 320, DOW at 2200, Gold $300/oz, and Corn $2/bu.
   No sign that housing, equities, or farmland are in a bubble- Yellen
   11/14/13
   The January 2015 AMZN put at $130 (cost $4.25) will be a winner.

   The difference between sex and******is consent.
   The States can stop this tomorrow. They can say something like the
   following:
   1. The Constitution will be followed inside the boundaries of this
   state.
   2. We refuse to recognize any law or regulation that violates same. We
   shall not remit to the federal government nor demand that any entity
   within our borders remit to the federal government any funds putatively
   assessed as a consequence of such a void act.
   3. Any person or entity that attempts to enforce such a law is in fact
   attempting to enforce a void act, and as such their attempted
   "enforcement" is whatever the criminal act would be absent such a
   claimed law.
   4. The peace officers of this State and its political subdivisions are
   empowered to and shall enforce the law against any such persons
   attempting to act in contravention of (3) above, including but not
   limited to the use of whatever force is necessary to effect arrests,
   and are further empowered to deputize for this purpose willing and able
   adults within our political boundaries as they deem appropriate should
   their level of staff prove inadequate.
   5. The prosecutors of this state shall try all such alleged crimes
   before a jury comprised of the people of this state and mete out
   punishment for conviction in accordance with our state statutes.
   There is no statute or amendment that can be passed to address a body
   that refuses to follow the highest law in the land. You either tell
   them to cut that **** out and, if they refuse, that you will imprison
   anyone who attempts to enforce void acts through the use of violence or
   coercion, or you accede to what they're doing.
   Putting more to-be-ignored words on paper when they're already being
   ignored is a waste of time; we have already seen that the States
   consent, and until that consent is withdrawn what the Federal
   Government is doing is not rape, it's sex.

   But it seems like the system is currently set up for any brave
   governors to fail:
   After a governor CeeLo Green'ing the federal's rules, then the federal
   gov't will cut off their benefits funds, the old people and the poor
   will say "what did you do that for, governor? Now we'll starve!!!" and
   the governor gets laughed out of office for "hating the poor and the
   elderly" and "refusing perfectly good benefits".
   Probably say he hates homosexuals too.
   WE can see the win in the choice you cite here (well, I can), but the
   **majority** of voters are going to impugn any upitty states' right
   governor as a madman as soon as their benefits are threatened, aren't
   they?
   This is how democracy fails - the benefits streams become all powerful.
   The stupid dominate the smart. The liars dominate the truthful.

   Is that before or after he locks up a couple of hospital executives and
   the price of medical care drops 90%? What happens when the price of gas
   drops 20 cents overnight (federal excise is 18.4.)?
   And on and on and on.
   How long before the medical tourism starts and the job creation in that
   state explodes upward? Days!
   Is there risk in such a path? Sure.

   What Karl is proposing is not all that far fetched. Jefferson, in the
   Kentucky Resolutions, said that states had the right to nullify
   unconstitutional laws within their boundaries. The real federal coup
   was when Marshall pulled his fast one in Marbury v. Madison, a case he
   should have recused himself from, and usurped the power of judicial
   review. As for nullification, the State of Wisconsin nullified the
   Fugitive Slave Act, and pretty much got away with that.

   Karl is right on the money with this whole subject. Nothing political
   needs to be done, no changes need be made to the US Constitution, and
   no courts need rule on this. US courts acknowledge Karl's points, as
   well.
   Marbury vs Madison, a court case out of 1803, while pulling a coup de
   tat also acknowledged that laws in conflict with the Constitution are
   void - no further action needed by any party.

Quote:

     Certainly all those who have framed written constitutions
     contemplate them as forming the fundamental and paramount law of the
     nation, and consequently the theory of every such government must
     be, that an act of the legislature, repugnant to the constitution,
     is void.

   Norton vs Shelby County, out of 1886, recognized the same principle in
   an even more direct fashion:

Quote:

     An unconstitutional act is not a law; it confers no rights; it
     imposes no duties; it affords no protection; it creates no office;
     it is in legal contemplation as inoperative as though it had never
     been passed.

   The Constitution is written in plain language (if you don't believe it,
   try reading the period letters to the editor known as the Federalist
   and Antifederalist Papers), and as Karl points out, the vast majority
   of actions taken today by governmental agents are in fact prima facie
   illegal as such actions are in direct conflict with the plain language
   of the US Constitution as it stands today.
   Agents of government acting under any such non-law are in fact literal
   criminals.

   What about taking property for public use. I believe that outlaws
   socialism. The police and the tax man aren't too slow to take your
   property. Even voting to take property in the form of taxes is nothing
   more than one group stealing the property of another.
   Without the bill of rights, the Constitution wouldn't have passed,
   because the people knew it was drawn up by a bunch of bankers and land
   speculators that wanted to feather their own nests. It was the
   distribution of power and property that made the USA what it was. We
   have a royalty in the US, though they are unseen. They run us from one
   war to the next. They run a system that protects the bankers while
   exposing the masses to loss. When the stuff hits the fan, you at best
   have the right to move your money from one bank to the next, but not to
   withdraw over a minimal amount of it. Then we have the bureaucracy,
   which itself is stripping the private sector of its power and property.
   It is not by chance that the richest counties in the US abut Washington
   DC. If you are going to do anything but exist, you need lawyers to
   function. It isn't the rich that are stripping the middle class, but
   the connected. The takings clause in the 5th was meant to mean more
   than they tell us it does today.

   I don't think a serious movement toward nullification/secession is
   going to develop, in Texas or anywhere else, as long as the national
   economy hangs together. Conversely, if and when it doesn't, I think
   there is going to be a serious movement toward them.

   Sorry for the length of this, but the evidence pile of democracy - our
   current government practice since amendment 17 was created - paints a
   tragic future for us, we will never vote our way out of this.
   The current behavior of the US government is entirely consistent with
   Democracy's wretched history. Democracy is our illness, not the people
   running it. People are ALWAYS selfish and short sighted on the whole.
   And democracy ALWAYS manifests humans worst mob rule behavior.
   Democracy has NEVER worked. Let's look at the history on this form of
   government, a history which predicts CLEARLY what we are seeing now.
   The majority simply votes to take the minority's belongings, and
   Polybius says they go mad and violent, both of which we are seeing in
   abundance now with the liberal constituency. Even the Republican party
   is a liberal party now, humans' greed cannot resist the false promise
   of gov't handouts "fixing" things.
   We have to cease being a democracy - somehow - if we hope to restore
   our rule of laws. The mob of voters is not going to become sane - they
   are going to get far far worse, if you believe what history tells us.
   Let's look at the history:
   --------------------
   Polybius observed the people become senseless and bribed by the
   politicians' handouts, exactly as we see now, vote buying on a massive
   scale and constant claims of "doing good" with every new abrogating of
   written law:
   "By which means when, in their senseless mania for reputation, they
   have made the populace ready and greedy to receive bribes, the virtue
   of democracy is destroyed, and it is transformed into a government of
   violence and the strong hand."
   ------------------------
   Plato described the madness using a ship analogy, again this seems spot
   on describing the US the last 40 years, not the :
   " Imagine then a ship or a fleet in which there is a captain who is
   taller and stronger than any of the crew, but who is a little deaf and
   has a similar infirmity in sight, and whose knowledge of navigation is
   not much better. The sailors are quarreling with one another about the
   steeringevery one is of the opinion that he has a right to steer,
   though he has never learned the art of navigation."
   "[The sailors] throng about the captain, begging and praying him to
   commit the helm to them; and if at any time they do not prevail, but
   others are preferred to them, they kill the others or throw them
   overboard, and having first chained up the noble captains senses with
   drink or some narcotic drug, they mutiny and take possession of the
   ship and make free with the stores, thus eating and drinking"
   "In their ignorance they tend to vote for politicians who beguile them
   with appearances and nebulous talk" . (Note: Plato did not say the
   voters were ignorant, he said they display ignorance)
   -------------------------
   The founders never once wanted a democracy - they feared democracy, it
   was a known, failed form of government in their time as well.
   ----------------------
   The founders feared handouts being a federal power - I can't find it
   mentioned or considered anywhere in their writings. It was a known,
   persistently failing government power in their time as well. Numerous
   quotes exist of Early US leaders citing that congress does not have the
   power to hand out money to the people.
   ----------------------
   Democracy leads to communism - Lenin considered it ESSENTIAL to
   socialism, the path to communism:
   Democracy is indispensable to socialism. -Vladimir Lenin
   -----------------------
   We are now communist in tens of ways:
   They're marching with communists,
   attending funerals of dead communist heros (Mandela),
   socializing with communists,
   protesting with communists,
   being admired by communists,
   joined as an allied party with communists,
   creating special rights like communists,
   spying on your phone calls like communists,
   bullying corporations into spying on you like communists,
   removing the rights of our opposition like communists,
   taking taxes from each according to ability like communists,
   handing benefits to they're supporters like communists,
   allowing corruption like communists,
   blaming new failures on prior, fake conservative leaders like
   communists,
   using the Supreme Court as a edict-creating, politburo; like
   communists,
   restricting religious expression like communists,
   and aligning gov't agencies against their opponents like communists,
