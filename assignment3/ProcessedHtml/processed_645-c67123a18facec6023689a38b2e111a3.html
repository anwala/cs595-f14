   Leicester City striker Jamie Vardy inspired the Foxes to an incredible
   comeback as they beat Manchester United 5-3 at the King Power Stadium.

   The former non-league striker had a hand in all five goals and scored
   one for himself on his first start of the season.

   First half strikes from Robin van Persie and Angel Di Maria had put the
   visitors two up inside a quarter of an hour, but a header from Leo
   Ulloa immediately dragged the Foxes level.

   Ander Herrera extended the advantage but a David Nugent penalty got
   Leicester back in the game before goals from Esteban Cambiasso and
   Vardy pulled off a remarkable turnaround.

   Youngster Tyler Blackett later saw red for United after hauling down
   the former Fleetwood man, conceding the penalty from which Ulloa added
   Leicester's fifth.

   Two of the Premier League's mid-table teams went head-to-head in
   England's East Midlands but much of the game's attacking play would not
   have looked out of place on Europe's most prestigious stage. The
   defending, however, was perhaps more at home in the Evo-Stik Northern
   Premier.

   Both sides held identical records going into the game: Played four, won
   one, drawn two, lost another.

   But while Nigel Pearson will be delighted with Leicester's start,
   having faced four of last season's top 10, United counterpart Louis van
   Gaal will have been hoping for more with Swansea and Sunderland their
   only opponents from last season's top flight.

   Their trip to the King Power was their third in a row against a newly
   promoted side and would be the toughest so far, on paper.

   Leicester's young squad, which has been carefully assembled over the
   best part of three years, ran away with the Championship last season
   thanks to a home record which boasted just two league defeats.

   But this was a new Manchester United, or so we thought, boosted by the
   world-class additions of Falcao, Di Maria and Daley Blind, and buoyed
   by a 4-0 hammering of QPR in their last outing.

   It took 10 minutes for van Gaal's men to deliver the game's first
   chance. Di Maria surged through the middle and, in his stride, slipped
   in van Persie, whose effort was blocked by the legs of an alert Kasper
   Schmeichel.

   It was an early warning for the Foxes, who were behind three minutes
   later. Falcao's turn escaped Ritchie De Laet down the left and he
   delivered an inch perfect cross to the far post where the Dutchman was
   lurking to stoop home, via a deflection.

   And the visitors wasted no time in doubling their advantage when Wayne
   Rooney strode forward, unchallenged, and found Di Maria on the edge of
   the box. The British record transfer did the rest: gracefully lifting
   the ball over the stranded Schmeichel without a split second of
   hesitation.

   The ex-Real Madrid man was again making a mockery of his former side's
   willingness to usher him out of Santiago Bernabeu.

   But for all their attacking exuberance, question marks remain over
   United's new-look back line, which was carved open straight from the
   kick-off as the home side levelled through their own record purchase,
   the Â£8m Ulloa.

   Vardy, returning from a thigh injury, skipped round Marcos Rojo and
   swept an inch perfect cross towards Ulloa, who rose above Rafael and
   powered his header inside the near post.

   It was a priceless goal for Leicester, halting United's new-found
   momentum and temporarily bringing last season's seventh-placed side
   back down to earth.

   But United were back in the swing of things shortly after the restart.
   Within four minutes, Falcao was millimetres away from bettering Di
   Maria's earlier goal: Rooney's dinked pass sat up well for the
   Colombian, whose volleyed lob off evaded Schmeichel and came crashing
   back off the crossbar.

   And they were back in control within 10 minutes - thanks to another new
   signing getting in on the act. Di Maria unleashed a low strike from 25
   yards, which appeared to be going wide until Herrera stuck out a heel
   to change the direction of the ball and send Schmeichel scrambling the
   wrong way.

   They say you're at your most vulnerable after scoring a goal and United
   seemed determined to prove it, this time conceding four minutes after
   Herrera had restored their two-goal cushion.

   It was the troublesome Vardy at the thick of things again. Rafael was
   bullied - and probably fouled - by the former Fleetwood man, who surged
   into the box and awaited the Brazilian's retaliation. It came, referee
   Mark Clattenburg pointed to the spot and Nugent - last season's top
   scorer with 20 - assumed responsibility to fire straight down the
   middle of David De Gea's goal.

   Leicester sensed blood and it was only two minutes before they were
   level. Dean Hammond's shot hit Vardy and fell into the path of
   Cambiasso, who gratefully guided the ball into De Gea's bottom corner.

   It would only get better from there and when United lost possession in
   the Foxes half, former Old Trafford youngster De Laet freed Vardy, who
   raced clear to sidefoot past De Gea with 11 minutes remaining.

   The King Power was rocking to the tune of "we want five" from the home
   faithful and when Vardy was again played in over the top, Blackett
   decided to grant them their wish: hauling down the man who was plucked
   from Conference football just two years ago, inside the box.

   Ulloa was on duty this time, picking out the bottom right and taking
   his league goals tally to five in five matches. Thankfully, for the
   deflated former champions, that would be that.

   Teams:

   Leicester: Schmeichel; De Laet, Morgan, Moore, Konchesky; Hammond,
   Cambiasso (King 71), Drinkwater; Vardy (Schlupp 85), Nugent (James 75),
   Ulloa.

   United: De Gea; Rafael, Evans (Smalling 30), Blackett, Rojo; Blind,
   Herrera, Di Maria (Mata 76), Rooney; Falcao (Januzaj 72), van Persie.
