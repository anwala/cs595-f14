[4]Accordion Headbands at Barbara Bui

   All us 90's kids are no doubt having major flashbacks with all the
   chokers, crops and well, the majority of recent high street trends. I
   was so happy when I saw my absolute fave 90's trend at the Barbara Bui
   Paris Fashion week show - The Accordion Headband!
   What do we think?

   If you would like one of these headbands, you can buy one in Claire's
   Accessories or for a little cheaper, on eBay!

[22]Manish Arora, my highlight from Paris Fashion Week

   Pastel colours, beading, retro embellishment, draping fabrics, all
   complimented with exquisite headwear and all with a delicate hint of
   India.

[45]Ooh naa naa, that's my name!

   From capes to handbags, branding your initials on your favourite item
   has been appearing everywhere recently. One of the first people to do
   this was everyones favourite sex writer and continuous question asker
   Carrie Bradshaw, who's whole life was turned upside down when she lost
   her name necklace.
   But it's not just sitcoms that this trend has been making an appearance
   in. At this years Vogue Fashion Night Out, personalisation was a
   highlight; brands were offering visitors the luxury of embellishing
   their purchases with their names. For those with a bigger budget, they
   could follow in the footsteps of Poppy Delevingne by purchasing a
   Superdry Leather Jacket which they could then customise. For those who
   didn't want to buy a leather jacket, they could pop to H&M and slap
   their initials on a canvas shopper.
   [46][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-25%2Bat%2B19.09.47.png]
   Poppy isn't the only celeb joining in on the trend of scrawling their
   name across their clothing. At a recent performance, Lily Allen was
   seen wearing this heavily beaded personalised top by Ashish.
   [47][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-24%2Bat%2B18.09.22.png]
   One of the trends we can't escape this season (and would we want to?),
   is the blanket cape. The British clothing house Burberry is no doubt
   dominating this trend. Every big name in the celeb and fashion world
   has been seen with a beautiful cape draped over their shoulders. But
   it's not just the cape trend Burberry are engaging in, they are also
   putting the initials on their capes! Burberry, you can do no wrong.
   [48][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-25%2Bat%2B19.20.23.png]
   I love luggage. Like literally love it so much. My dream is to one day
   earn enough money so that I can buy a Louis Vuitton suitcase. Luggage
   has just always had the association of glamour and luxury. How could
   you make something which is so luxurious become even more alluring? Add
   your initials to it! Just imagine how Hollywood you'll feel with your
   magazine in one hand, Pret stuffed in your hand luggage, sunnies
   pushing your hair back and most importantly beautiful personalised
   luggage carefully rolling behind you (even if it is just about to be
   squeezed in the Easyjet overhead compartments).
   [49][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-25%2Bat%2B19.07.34.png]
   Don't feel down, it's not just bigger budgets that can afford
   personalised luggage. I found quite a few cheaper companies that
   stocked monogram travel gear too, as shown below.
   [50][luggage.png]
   This travel set is made by Annabel Chaffer and is certainly a lot nicer
   on the bank balance compared to a LV purchase.
   If you're not much of a luggage lover but still want some sort of bag,
   theres plenty of choices of monogram clutches. I found that the best
   ones were actually on Etsy.
   [51][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-25%2Bat%2B21.20.41.png]
   [52][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-25%2Bat%2B21.23.02.png]
   Here are just two of the bags found on Etsy.
   What I love the most about this trend is that it is the epitmation of
   putting your mark on it. Slight problem is that my initials don't look
   that great (OL just doesn't have a good ring to it)  but for all you
   with fab initials, hope you enjoy the trend!

[80]How I'm dealing with my Fashion Week hangover

   Fashion Week, great for the soul, bad for the body. Long hours mixed
   with a lot of fun results in a gut full of sweets, Itsu and champagne.
   At the time this was of course very enjoyable but I'm certainly feeling
   the effects. I am however, one of the lucky ones that's managed to have
   a couple of days off recover. And here's what I've been doing:
   Lack of sleep
   Turned the alarm off. As complicated as that.
   Horrendous skin
   Seriously, my skin is horrendous. Spots, spots and more spots resting
   on a bed of dullness. This was no doubt a result of days and days of
   make-up which was topped up throughout the day. As well as the make-up
   was the London pollution and the crap food. To help clear my blemishes
   I've used this face mask bought from my local natural health shop
   Infinity Foods.
   [81][facemask.jpeg]
   Bad diet
   Managing a healthy diet is particularly important for me, not just for
   vanity, but more importantly for my health. I suffer from a lot of
   intolerances which means I can be victim to constantly feeling ill.
   Eating on the go for the past week, has meant that I had to consume a
   lot of meals that could have potentially contained the foods I usually
   avoid. In addition, there were times where I was certain I couldn't eat
   anything that was available, so I had to resort to sweets. There were
   also the times where I just ate sweets because well, they looked really
   nice and they were free.
   To help me get over my poor diet, I've been cutting down on artificial
   products (something I try to do anyway), cut down on processed carbs
   and really make sure I'm sticking to my gluten free, egg free and dairy
   free diet (yes it's a nightmare but it can be done). My meals have
   included lots of veg and lots of white meat (I'm cutting out red meat
   but that's for environmental reasons). Although I'd like to portray
   myself as one of those uber disciplined 'instafit' type, I do have a
   sweet tooth. To fulfil this, I made gluten, egg and dairy free cookies
   which are almost sugar free!
   [82][dinner.jpeg]
   This is my jerk bowl. It's so easy and actually so yummy. I grilled
   jerk and cumin seasoned turkey with onions and courgette which I then
   mixed with boiled green beans, broccoli and cauliflower. Once they were
   all together, I added tomato puree and seasoned with more jerk, cumin
   and pepper. The white you can see is fake cheese which is a close copy
   to actual cheese. I grill everything with coconut oil. It's a lot
   lighter and a lot better for you compared to some other oils.
   [83][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-23%2Bat%2B22.08.48.png]
   These are my egg, dairy, gluten free cookies. When I bake I do
   everything by eye so I can't really put the recipe up. I'll do them
   again and be more careful with the ingredients.
   That feeling of pollution all over your body
   You know that feeling where you feel so grubby you just want to go to a
   spa and get a full body scrub? Well I had that but couldn't afford a
   spa. I did however, have a Frank coffee scrub in my Shopcade goodie bag
   which I smothered my body with.
   [84][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-23%2Bat%2B22.09.08.png]
   After doing all of the above, I'm starting to feel almost back to my
   original self.

[109]Want a white shirt that doesn't resemble your first day of year 7? I
have the answer.

    White shirts are a key component to almost any work wardrobe, however
   finding a nice one that's reflective of todays meeting rather than
   gossiping in the playground is really hard to find. I am forever
   looking for a shirt that doesn't scream running to lunch whilst holding
   my backpack to my shoulder blades. I want to wear a shirt that's not
   only comfortable but also stylish. So I've compiled a list which are
   perfect for every budget.
   [110][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-20%2Bat%2B13.45.03.png]
    Remember that white shirt you wore in the summer term? Well now you
   can have a more flattering version with a delicate edge. Can be found
   in Topshop, Â£36.00
   [111][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-20%2Bat%2B13.45.43.png]
   I really like the bejewelling on the collar of this shirt. It's still
   quite plain which means it would look lovely with patterned trousers.
   Also from Topshop, Â£38.00
   [112][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-20%2Bat%2B13.47.42.png]
   Those with bigger boobs can have issues with shirts with a collar, this
   collarless blouse can be your secret weapon. The beautiful satin
   material means that it will also hang nicer than shirts made from
   synthetic materials. This pricier shirt is made by Jaeger, Â£150.00
   [113][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-20%2Bat%2B13.48.59.png]
   Want to wear a plain white shirt that isn't completely plain? This
   shirt has black bows which can add a new dimension. Shirt made by
   Reiss, Â£110.
   [114][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-22%2Bat%2B14.59.09.png]
   If you really want to wear a white shirt whilst simultaneously not
   wearing a white shirt Alexander Wang has the answer. This stylish shirt
   is off-white and of crepe fabric which allows the shirt to be simple
   but also different. Those with a bigger budget can buy this T by
   Alexander Wang shirt on Net-a-Porter, Â£255.
   [115][Screen%2BShot%2B2014-09-22%2Bat%2B15.00.13.png]
   Are you feeling inspired by romanticism and want a price you can fall
   in love with? This shirt is perfect. You can buy this shirt from H&M,
   Â£19.99.

[144]What it's really like to be an intern at London Fashion Week (Part four)

   Waking up at 11am is an extreme luxury I get to indulge in. I have time
   to pick an outfit and don't have to do my make-up on the train. When I
   get back to the Shopcade Pop-up, I remember how much I'm enjoying this
   week. The pop-up closes and its time to start getting the area ready
   for the V.I.P party. We quickly rush over to Pret and I eat the same
   meal that I've eaten every day (I'm dairy, gluten and egg intolerant so
   very limited to what I can eat). Glitter Lips still on, we are ready to
   start the party.
   Myself and my friend Lucy are manning the door which is surprisingly a
   really fun task. You get to speak to loads of different people which is
   not only interesting, but very useful for networking. When it comes to
   doing tasks like this, there's a tip I'd give to everyone: research
   your guests! As I said in an earlier post, I don't really watch
   television so I'm not up to date with the reality stars. Rather than
   find the time to watch tele, I googled the guests. Please interns, you
   do not want to embarrass yourselves, do your research. To be clear, I
   don't mean this exclusively to 'famous' people, know your industry
   people and those that are good friends with the company you are
   representing; really get to know your guest list! This being said, I
   want to be clear that you should treat all guests with respect. There's
   nothing impressive about being a 'door bitch'. Everyone that is
   standing waiting to get in, wants to come to your event and that's a
   compliment. In fact, they've chosen to come to your event when they are
   probably exhausted from a long day on their feet. So, when it comes to
   hosting a guest list, remember to really get to grips with who's going
   to be coming and never forget to BE NICE!
   The nights over and I'm excitedly looking through my goodie bag during
   my taxi ride to my friends house. It's lovely that I get to stay with a
   friend from Uni, especially after this somewhat surreal week. We giggle
   over her horrendous graduation picture (sorry Em) and we talk as if we
   are back in our disgusting student house. I've got one day off then its
   back working on a LFW closing party.
   It's the last day of LFW and I'm collecting make-up in Covent Garden
   whilst balancing the social media coverage for tonight's party. This
   evening's event is for a different company, so I need to quickly pick
   up from where I last left off. I'm slightly panicking as I sit having
   my lunch opposite Fashion Scout: 'Where can I find clothes for the
   event tonight?'. I'm looking through my contacts in hope to not
   disappoint my boss. I notice two people I met at the Bora Aksu show and
   I smile although I don't think they recognise me. I carry on wishfully
   scrolling through my contacts until I notice a boy sitting at my table.
   'Hi, I met you the other day' Kieran says. I'm so flattered he
   remembers me! He asks me what I'm doing and I explain. Within seconds
   Kieran turns from industry friend to genuine angel sent from heaven. He
   gives me the press office number of a fantastic company and I feel a
   massive weight off my shoulders. I want this to be a little lesson to
   not only myself, but to other interns; always do your networking (stay
   tuned for my post on this). If I hadn't spoken to Kieran earlier on in
   the week, he wouldn't have saved my bum when I needed it most! Contacts
   saved onto my phone, I've finally completed all my pre-party errands so
   I hop over to the venue in Shoreditch.
   Absolutely exhausted from the week, all I want to do is get in my bed.
   I make sure I've done everything I need to do before I call a taxi. I'm
   finally home and I throw my outfit onto the pile of everything else
   I've worn this week. I think to myself how I'll clean it tomorrow and
   literally fall into bed.

[161]What it's really like being an intern at London Fashion Week (part
three)

   Feet still swelling, there's no way I'm wearing heels again (well,
   until tonight). I arrive to the Shopcade pop-up and I get excited
   again. My boss greets me and explains cheerily that there's a different
   task I have to do (I feel very thankful that I've got to do these
   'alternative' tasks twice now). I get briefed by the two lovely boys of
   Candid Magazine who want me to go down to Somerset House and report
   back on 'street style'. Before I head down, I remember how bold
   everyone looks on the cobbles so I quickly visit the the girls at the
   Glitter Lips stand and glam up.
   Approaching smartly dressed boys at the BFC Courtyard is surprisingly
   easy; practically everyone wants their photo taken. Note book in hand,
   I take down designer after designer, name after name. I remember that
   I've got a press pass, so decide to use the 'special' toilets (anyone
   that knows me will know the excitement I would feel towards this). In
   the buyers and press lounge everyone is sitting on laptops chatting
   away. I feel proud to be a part of it all.
   [162][10632854_10154535043905386_6366591521938619823_n.jpg]
   Back at the Shopcade Pop-up there's such a buzz. Everyone is having a
   really good time. I grab another intern and we head over to Fashion
   Scout to spread the word on what's going on. A girl comes over and asks
   to take a picture of me for a blog she works for. I AM ABSOLUTELY [DEL:
   DELIGHTED :DEL] ECSTATIC. As I said earlier, practically everyone at
   Fashion Week is thrilled to have their photo taken, in fact it's almost
   the prime goal.
   [163][10646856_893556257338853_6022939454537732544_n.jpg]
   I'm back at the Pop-up and I've had my make-up done ready for tonight.
   Myself and another intern quickly grab some dinner then it's time for
   the We are Collision party. The room starts filling up and I see a lot
   of familiar faces (by familiar, I mean people I've seen at various
   shows and events this week). I get talking to a boy who recognises me
   from the Bora Aksu show. He explains to me how he has to miss the end
   of LFW because Uni begins again tomorrow. That's the thing about LFW,
   everyone is grafting their 'bums off'. Everyone knows that to make it,
   you'll probably be doing 20 hour days for free. But this is something
   everyone does, and everyone does quite happily.
   After a couple of hours and some ushering of a few famous faces to have
   their picture taken, I'm ready to go home. I get on the packed last
   train and eat all my free dried fruit and drink my coconut water. The
   boys next to me seem very confused by my glitter lips (which can I say,
   stayed on all day after having two meals and hot drinks!) which I
   completely forgot I was wearing. The two hour journey is spent with all
   of us strangers discussing everything from asian weddings to healthy
   ice cream. I get into bed and set my alarm. Bring on tomorrow!
