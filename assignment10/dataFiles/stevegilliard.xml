Five American service members were killed in a hail of grenades and gunfire in a breach of security that Iraqi officials called unprecedented.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attack, which lasted roughly 20 minutes, came on a day when the United States lost at least 20 other troops, including a dozen in a helicopter crash, making it the third most lethal day for American forces in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, the military announced the arrival of 3,200 troops of the 82nd Airborne Division&#39;s 2nd Brigade Combat Team, the first unit to reach Baghdad as part of a 21,500-troop increase that the Bush administration hopes will restore order in the violent capital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Soldiers from the 82nd come to us ready to engage in a wide variety of operations in support of the Iraqi Baghdad Security Plan,&quot; Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, the second-ranking U.S. commander in Iraq, said in a statement. &quot;The brigade adds operational flexibility that will assist in securing the population.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. military officials said Sunday that they could not discuss the attack in Karbala in detail because it remained under investigation. But they said the version of events provided by the governor&#39;s office was consistent with their preliminary findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After arriving at the Provincial Joint Coordination Center in Karbala, 60 miles southwest of Baghdad, the attackers detonated sound bombs, Iraqi officials said. &quot;They wanted to create a panic situation,&quot; said an aide to Karbala Gov. Akeel al-Khazaali, who described the events with the governor&#39;s permission but on condition of anonymity because he fears reprisals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The men then stormed into a room where Americans and Iraqis were making plans to ensure the safety of thousands of people expected to visit the holy city for an upcoming holiday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;They didn&#39;t target anyone but the American soldiers,&quot; the governor&#39;s aide said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the attack, the assailants returned to their vehicles and drove away. It was unclear how many people participated, and the men&#39;s identities and motive remained unclear, but the attack was particularly striking because of the resources and sophistication involved, Iraqi officials said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So who sent this message? AQ? The Mahdi Army? the Revolutionary Guards? Someone who needs to understand that the US is vunerable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The uniforms and money spent indicates someone with time to spare. I would hope dunderhead Odierno would realize that all hell could follow at the choosing of some party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because if the Mahdi Army is this slick, God help our troops.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116949731546900016/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116949731546900016&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116949731546900016'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116949731546900016'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/so-who-did-this.html' title='So who did this?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116947995858968988</id><published>2007-01-22T10:22:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-22T10:32:39.186-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Shut yer festerin&#39; gob</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20070117/capt.do80801171631.spain_blessing_of_the_animals_do808.jpg?x=236&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=MX7x1SH1t8yUYTVw8ciYhA--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20070117/capt.do80801171631.spain_blessing_of_the_animals_do808.jpg?x=236&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=MX7x1SH1t8yUYTVw8ciYhA--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;I&#39;d rather take advice from a cat before I would&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;take if from Frank Luntz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/frank-luntz/words-that-dont-work_b_39208.html&quot;&gt;Frank Luntz&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I am not in the habit of offering partisan linguistic advice to Democrats. But in the genuine spirit of bipartisanship - seriously - I thought this is the perfect time to convey a simple point to the still-euphoric faces of Democrat activists ...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t twist the knife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s briefly sketch the political landscape in America today.&lt;br /&gt;Republicans are still reeling quite deservedly from the political thumping they took in the November election.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The polls, pretty bad then, have gotten even worse. One-by-one, key Republicans on the Hill are parting ways with the President over the &#39;surge&#39; and his &#39;new strategy&#39; in Iraq. And to top it all off, a Washington Post-ABC News poll taken immediately after the President&#39;s speech showed that a mere 40% of Americans believe the war is worth fighting, up just four points from before the speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An emerging new majority has spoken, and it is not happy with the old politics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Republicans are a party in peril, but all is not milk and cookies in Democrat land. The Democrats - flush with majority status - have a crucial choice right now. They can use their newly-won mandate to settle some old scores...or they can get responsibly and move ahead. They would be wise to opt for the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Democracy is at its best when its practioners use language to unite and explain rather than divide and attack. The blogs from the Left and the Right be damned, the real center of America is upset but not bitter, anxious but not fearful, restless but not unforgiving.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For two years the Republican Party was adrift in meaningless messaging to support meaningless reform - and have communicated absolutely nothing for the past three months. By comparison, the Democrat majority that took Congress in November was remarkably disciplined and effective in promoting change, reform, and accountability in the weeks following their historic election.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But alas, power does strange things to Democrats: put a gavel in their hands and a camera in their face and they revert to the name-calling that kept them from the majority for a dozen long years. Sure, it&#39;s easy to land rhetorical jabs on a staggering opponent - but that doesn&#39;t make it effective. The message from the electorate in November was &#39;work together and compromise.&#39; You need only look at the incumbent governor of California who won a lopsided landslide in an otherwise Democratic sweep. Cooperation works. Compromise wins. But over-heated rhetoric says to the world that you are no different - and no better - than what you replaced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.....................&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ignore this stupid motherfucker&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GOP are the largest bunch of whining children I have ever seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Bush says vote Republican or die and now, when the Dems have real power, he wants to hand out lectures on not twisitng knives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Where was he when Tom Delay was around. Sucking his balls. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GOP likes compromise when they are the minority. When they&#39;re the majority, they can bully and lie like it&#39;s free.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116947995858968988/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116947995858968988&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116947995858968988'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116947995858968988'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/shut-yer-festerin-gob.html' title='Shut yer festerin&#39; gob'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116947504455237421</id><published>2007-01-22T09:08:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-22T09:10:44.586-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Too close for comfort</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/22/business/22porn.600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0pt 10px 10px 0pt; float: left; cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/22/business/22porn.600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Jesse Jane plans cosmetic surgery to hide &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;imperfections newly visible.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/business/media/22porn.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=business&amp;amp;adxnnlx=1169474781-CslQMu0svyibOu2eAB3rFg&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Raw World of Sex Movies, High Definition Could Be a View Too Real&lt;br /&gt;Digital Playground&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By MATT RICHTEL&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 22, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 21 — The XXX industry has gotten too graphic, even for its own tastes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stormy Daniels says she isn’t sure “why anyone would want to see their porn” in high definition because it makes the picture so crisp and clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pornography has long helped drive the adoption of new technology, from the printing press to the videocassette. Now pornographic movie studios are staying ahead of the curve by releasing high-definition DVDs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have discovered that the technology is sometimes not so sexy. The high-definition format is accentuating imperfections in the actors — from a little extra cellulite on a leg to wrinkles around the eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollywood is dealing with similar problems, but they are more pronounced for pornographers, who rely on close-ups and who, because of their quick adoption of the new format, are facing the issue more immediately than mainstream entertainment companies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Producers are taking steps to hide the imperfections. Some shots are lit differently, while some actors simply are not shot at certain angles, or are getting cosmetic surgery, or seeking expert grooming.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The biggest problem is razor burn,” said Stormy Daniels, an actress, writer and director.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Daniels is also a skeptic. “I’m not 100 percent sure why anyone would want to see their porn in HD,” she said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The technology’s advocates counter that high definition, by making things clearer and crisper, lets viewers feel as close to the action as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It puts you in the room,” said the director known as Robby D., whose films include “Sexual Freak.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pornographers’ progress with HD may also be somewhat slowed by Sony, one of the main backers of the Blu-ray high-definition disc format. Sony said last week that, in keeping with a longstanding policy, it would not mass-produce pornographic videos on behalf of the movie makers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decision has forced pornographers to use the competing HD-DVD format or, in some cases, to find companies other than Sony that can manufacture copies of Blu-ray movies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The movie makers assert that it is shortsighted of Sony to snub them, given how pornography helps technologies spread.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“When you’re introducing a new format, it would seem like the adult guys can help,” said Steven Hirsch, co-chief executive officer of Vivid Entertainment Group, a big player in the industry. Mr. Hirsch added that high definition, regardless of format, “is the future.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the challenges, pornographers — who distributed some 7,000 new movies on DVD last year and sold discs worth $3.6 billion in the United States — are rapidly moving to high-definition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One major company, Digital Playground, plans to release its first four HD-DVD titles this month, and plans four new ones each month. In March, Vivid plans to release “Debbie Does Dallas ... Again,” its first feature for both HD-DVD and Blu-ray.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116947504455237421/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116947504455237421&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116947504455237421'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116947504455237421'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/too-close-for-comfort.html' title='Too close for comfort'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116944414231474741</id><published>2007-01-22T00:30:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-22T00:35:52.696-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Racist pig speaks</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/502417/pig.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/113287/pig.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;ppt739655&quot;&gt;Limbaugh: Classless Players Look Like Bloods and Crips&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;Posted Jan 20th 2007 8:22PM by &lt;a href=&quot;http://nfc-north.aolsportsblog.com/bloggers/michael-david-smith&quot;&gt;Michael David Smith&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In 2003, Rush Limbaugh &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/gen/news/2003/1001/1628537.html&quot;&gt;resigned from ESPN&lt;/a&gt; after creating a controversy with his comments that Donovan McNabb got too much credit because, he said, &quot;&lt;font&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;scopy&quot;&gt;The media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well.&#39;&#39; Limbaugh no longer works as an NFL commentator, but his latest comments about football are sure to get more scrutiny.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_011907/content/quotes.guest.html&quot;&gt;Limbaugh&#39;s web site includes the following two statements&lt;/a&gt; that he made on his Friday show:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&quot;There is a cultural problem in the NFL that has resulted in a total lack of class on the part of professional players. I love the game of football, but after every sack players are acting like they&#39;ve won the Super Bowl; they&#39;re prancing around with these idiotic dances.&quot; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;and&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&quot;Look, let me put it to you this way: the NFL all too often looks like a game between the Bloods and the Crips without any weapons. There, I said it.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limbaugh has a fair, legitimate point with his first statement. Limbaugh&#39;s &quot;lack of class&quot; comment is quite similar to &lt;a href=&quot;http://nfl.aolsportsblog.com/2007/01/14/ladainian-tomlinson-patriots-bill-belichick-have-no-class/&quot;&gt;LaDainian Tomlinson&#39;s comments&lt;/a&gt; after the Chargers lost to the Patriots, although we should add that Tomlinson&#39;s teammate Shawne Merriman is as guilty as anyone when it comes to prancing around with idiotic dances after sacks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Limbaugh undermines that legitimate point with his second statement, though. To compare NFL players to gang members is to display willful ignorance about the men who play in the league. Which of the top players in tomorrow&#39;s game act like gang members on the field? Peyton Manning and Marvin Harrison? Tom Brady and Richard Seymour? Drew Brees and Reggie Bush? Thomas Jones and Brian Urlacher? All of those players and nearly all of the 180 or so players on the four teams we&#39;ll watch tomorrow are class acts. If Limbaugh doesn&#39;t know that, he doesn&#39;t know much about football. Which leaves me still scratching my head, three years later, as to why ESPN hired him.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116944414231474741/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116944414231474741&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116944414231474741'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116944414231474741'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/racist-pig-speaks.html' title='Racist pig speaks'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116944322603296065</id><published>2007-01-22T00:16:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-22T00:20:26.053-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Here we go again</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/22/business/22mixtape1.190.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/22/business/22mixtape1.190.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/business/22mixtape.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;Cracking Down on Mixtape CDs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By JEFF LEEDS&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 22, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not long before Christmas, Jeff Baker, the chief of police of Morrow, Ga., a small town just south of Atlanta, and one of his officers were walking through a local shopping mall when they happened to pass a kiosk hawking rap music CDs. One in particular caught their attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The CD was “Tha Streets Iz Watchin,” with songs performed by the rapper Young Jeezy and, as Chief Baker recalled, it did not carry the name or address of the owner of the music copyrights, as Georgia law requires. Rather than arrest the kiosk vendor immediately, Chief Baker said, “We’d rather go after the source of the material. And at that point we had no idea what the source was.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any rap music aficionado would; the creator of the album is DJ Drama, whose real name is Tyree Simmons, arguably the nation’s most prominent producer of mixtapes, the name given to popular but largely unlicensed CDs stocked with yet-to-be released rap hits and free-style rhymes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And many more people now know: last week, local authorities, working with the recording industry’s trade association, stunned fans and music executives alike by raiding DJ Drama’s studio in Atlanta and arresting him and a fellow D.J., Don Cannon, on racketeering charges. Investigators seized more than 81,000 allegedly pirated CDs and say the pair were producing unlicensed recordings and selling them without permission.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The raid sparked an outcry among many rap fans. But it also threatens to throw into public view the recording industry’s awkward relationship with mixtapes, long an integral element of rap culture and now commonly for sale on street corners, Web sites, many independent record shops and occasionally big chains.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as industry-financed antipiracy squads hunt for unauthorized recordings, senior executives at the major record labels privately say that they have courted — and often paid — top D.J.’s to create and distribute mixtapes featuring the labels’ rappers as part of efforts to generate buzz.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The record industry seems intent on alienating their audience</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116944322603296065/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116944322603296065&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116944322603296065'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116944322603296065'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/here-we-go-again.html' title='Here we go again'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116944285270790868</id><published>2007-01-22T00:10:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-22T00:14:12.726-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Failure</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/752886/24iraq-medical2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/257919/24iraq-medical2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkprogress.org/2007/01/21/kristol-iraq-quiet/&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kristol On War Critics: ‘It’s So Irresponsible That They Can’t Be Quiet For Six Or Nine Months’&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This morning on Fox News, Weekly Standard editor William Kristol said that opponents of escalation in Congress are “leap-frogging each other in the degrees of irresponsibility they’re willing to advocate.” Kristol said, “It’s just unbelievable. … It’s so irresponsible that they can’t be quiet for six or nine months,” adding, “You really wonder, do they want it to work or not? I really wonder that.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NPR’s Juan Williams told Kristol his analysis was “totally ahistorical,” and pointed out that yesterday was the deadliest day for U.S forces in Iraq in two years. “There’s something going on here you might pay attention to as opposed to just the politics of, ‘If you don’t support this president, you don’t really want us to win.’”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Watch it:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Digg It!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Full transcript:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   KRISTOL: They’re playing — they’re leap-frogging each other in the degrees of irresponsibility they’re willing to advocate. And I really think people are being too sort of complacent and forgiving almost of the Democrats. ‘Oh, it’s politics, of course. One of them has a non-binding resolution. The other has a cap.’ It’s all totally irresponsible. It’s just unbelievable. The president is sending over a new commander, he’s sending over troops, and the Democratic Congress, in a pseudo-binding way or non-binding way, is saying, ‘It won’t work. Forget it. You troops, you’re going over there in a pointless mission. Iraqis who might side with us, forget it, we’re going to pull the plug.’ It’s so irresponsible that they can’t be quiet for six or nine months and say the president has made a decision, we’re not going to change that decision, we’re not going to cut off funds and insist on the troops coming back, so let’s give it a chance to work. You really wonder, do they want it to work or not? I really wonder that. I hate to say this about the Democrats. They’re people I know personally and I respect some of them. Do they want it to succeed or not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   WILLIAMS: I think everybody wants it to succeed who believes in the idea that we are over there and our people are at stake. I don’t think there’s any question. I think that’s sort of a rhetorical tool on your part. But your analysis seems to be totally ahistorical. It’s as if mistakes haven’t been made repeatedly, as if people don’t feel like they’ve been misled down this path, that there’s been tremendous support for this president and war effort and it’s come to naught. It’s come to a bad place. Yesterday was the deadliest, I think, in two years. Nineteen Americans killed. There’s something going on here you might pay attention to as opposed to just the politics of, if you don’t support this president, you don’t really want us to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   KRISTOL: What are Democrats doing that would change the 19 Americans that were killed yesterday? Nothing. Zero. Except, except no reinforcements. You guys are on your own. That’s what they’re saying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   WILLIAMS: If you think — do you think reinforcements will make some radical change? No. I think what people are saying is, it’s time to redeploy, look at new strategies, look at political compromise. That’s what’s not being done by this administration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Bill Kristol was responsible, he&#39;d listen to the critics and stop pretending the surge will work</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116944285270790868/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116944285270790868&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116944285270790868'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116944285270790868'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/failure.html' title='Failure'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116944250011015219</id><published>2007-01-22T00:02:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-22T00:08:20.176-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Middle School?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/555237/children_10.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/29843/children_10.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/22/education/22middle.html?hp&amp;ex=1169442000&amp;amp;amp;en=dc0e476c07ea0807&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt; Taking Middle Schoolers Out of the Middle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By ELISSA GOOTMAN&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 22, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;When John Smith, a swaggering sixth grader at one of New York City’s growing collection of kindergarten- through eighth-grade schools, feels lost, he heads downstairs to the colorful classroom of his former third-grade teacher, Randi Silverman, for what she calls a “Silverman hug.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“When I get mad I go to her,” John, 11, said amid the lunchtime buzz in the cafeteria of his school, Public School 105, on the Rockaway peninsula in Queens. “When I feel frustrated I’ll go to her. When I feel like I can’t do it no more I go to her, and she tells me I have to do it.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miles away at Frederick Douglass Academy in Harlem, a 6th- through 12th-grade school, teachers keep the sixth graders looking forward, toward college. One recent morning, a class peppered a guidance counselor, Michael Lloyd, with queries, from “Where is Harvard?” to “What does Ph.D. stand for?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two schools, in disparate corners of the nation’s largest school system, are part of a national effort to rethink middle school, driven by increasingly well-documented slumps in learning among early adolescents as well as middle school crime rates and stubborn high school dropout rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The schools share the premise that the way to reverse years of abysmal middle school performance is to get rid of middle schools entirely. But they represent opposite poles in the sharp debate over whether 11- through 13-year-olds are better off pushed toward adulthood or coddled a little longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should the nurturing cocoon of elementary school be extended for another three years, shielding 11-year-olds from the abrupt transition to a new school, with new students and teachers, at one of the most volatile times in their lives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paul Vallas, chief executive of the Philadelphia school system, thinks so, and he has closed 17 traditional middle schools since 2002, while converting some three dozen elementary schools into K-8s. “The fifth to sixth grade transition is just too traumatic,” he said. “At a time when children are undergoing emotional, physical, social changes, and when they need stability and consistency, suddenly they’re thrust into this alien environment.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others argue that 11-, 12- and 13-year-olds thrive in the presence of older role models and reminders of concrete goals, like playing varsity sports and getting into college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Kids are forward-looking — they don’t get nostalgic for second grade when they’re in third grade,” said Larry Woodbridge, principal of the Secondary School for Law in Park Slope, Brooklyn, where the award-winning high school debate team will teach a middle school social studies unit this spring. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think if you&#39;re going to have a middle school, you need to have it start at 5th, not 6th Grade. When I went to school, I started in 7th grade. But either way, I think the crucial age is 12.

Most other cabinet members are horrified at the thought - and the scene is set for a political holy war. Francis Elliott reports&lt;br /&gt;Published: 21 January 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;She is a devout Catholic and member of the Opus Dei sect. His leanings to Rome have been rewarded with audiences in front of successive Popes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, when Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly team up to deny gay couples equal access to church-run adoption agencies, as we reveal today, it is little wonder that their opponents believe it is the &quot;Catholic tendency&quot; at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We are descending into a spiral of immorality,&quot; said Cardinal Keith O&#39;Brien, leader of the Catholic church in Scotland, when that country brought its laws into line with those of the rest of the UK to allow local authorities to place children with gay parents, just before Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a further change in the law to remove from Catholic-run adoption agencies the right to ban gay people threatens to provoke a full-scale battle throughout the UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Archbishop Vincent Nichols, who is set to become the leader of England&#39;s Catholics, recently warned the Government not to &quot;impose on us conditions which contradict our moral values&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It is simply unacceptable to suggest that the resources of... adoption agencies ... can work in co-operation with public authorities only if the faith communities accept not just the legal framework but also the moral standards being touted by the Government,&quot; he sermonised last November.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to Mr Blair, the archbishop is preaching to the converted, according to senior ministers. The Prime Minister first asked Alan Johnson, then responsible, to include a loophole in anti-discrimination legislation to allow the Catholic ban on gay parents early last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When he refused, the PM moved him and handed the equalities brief to Ms Kelly, whom he knew could be trusted to back him on the issue. But a cabinet row last October delayed the introduction of the Equality Act until this April.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms Kelly now has to produce the regulations that spell out exactly how the new law will work, and the pressure is building towards an explosive political battle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Johnson remains implacably opposed to any exemption and is being supported by Peter Hain, Jack Straw, David Miliband, Des Browne and even Mr Blair&#39;s close friend Lord Falconer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For his part, the Prime Minister can count only on Ms Kelly and John Hutton if the issue is pressed to the point of a full meeting of the cabinet committee that settles disputes on domestic policy. Members of the Domestic Affairs Committee, chaired by John Prescott, have been expecting a letter from Ms Kelly on the new regulations for weeks. Her aides say she will send them her proposals this week after further &quot;detailed policy discussions with colleagues&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Mr Blair can&#39;t count on much support among backbenchers. Angela Eagle, who topped a recent election to become the vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party, and Chris Bryant, MP for Rhondda, have been leading behind-the-scenes efforts to defeat the &quot;Catholic tendency&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a meeting last week Ms Kelly insisted that her wish to allow church-run adoption agencies to discriminate against gay couples had nothing to do with her own religious sensibilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, the Communities Secretary said, she was acting in the best interests of vulnerable children since the Catholic bishops were threatening to close the seven agencies run by the church rather than comply.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bishops point across the Atlantic at the example provided by the closure of an adoption agency by the Catholic church in Boston after the passing of anti-discrimination laws. It could no longer reconcile its operation with the Vatican ruling that gay adoption was &quot;gravely immoral&quot;, it said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At least in the UK, this is deemed offensive and unacceptable.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116939987905876269/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116939987905876269&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116939987905876269'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116939987905876269'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/no-kids-for-gays.html' title='No kids for gays'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116938330944369601</id><published>2007-01-21T07:41:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-21T07:41:49.460-05:00</updated><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Warren Zevon - Roland The Headless Thompson Gunner&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot;

As one of the reporters covering the Redskins for The Post, I needed a television and a way to record games so I could analyze what turned out to be a five-win season. A $119 combination 13-inch TV with a VCR would have solved the problem.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, I ended up taking the high-definition plunge, spending $1,399 for a far-bigger and fancier television set than I originally had in mind. As I left the store with my new HDTV, my confidence was boosted by approving nods from people in the parking lot.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Most new HDTVs have inputs for both types of high-definition cables, but not all video sources - cable or satellite boxes, upconverting DVD players or high-def video game consoles - use the same connections. Both types of cables can sell from $10 to $100, with minimal difference in quality. (Ignore composite and S-Video connections, which can?t carry a high-def signal.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It&#39;s going to change your life,&quot; one man said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If only someone had told me that buying the set was the easiest part.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, I have been riding a high-definition roller coaster -- mesmerized by the new TV&#39;s crystal-clear images but disillusioned by the disappointingly low number of HD channels you get in exchange for the investment of the upgrade.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My purchase put me in a growing wave of people switching to high definition. Last year, more than 13 million HDTV sets were shipped to stores in the United States, and the Consumer Electronics Association predicts that even more -- closer to 16 million -- will hit shelves this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moving into HDTV had been on my mind for a while. I&#39;d been admiring a 50-inch plasma, and its dropping price tag, for about a year, but I was still fighting the psychological barrier of paying such big money for a TV. I&#39;d spent less than $300 on a 27-inch Toshiba tube set only four years ago and wasn&#39;t mentally ready to shell out four figures for a replacement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so, faced with the onset of the season and needing a second set at home, I headed out with self-restraint and intentions of saving money by going low-tech -- until I started comparing prices and saw how much they had come down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A 27-inch tube set is the same price today as the one I bought four years ago, around $275, but a Polaroid 20-inch flat-panel, HD television was less than $50 more, at $318. A 32-inch combination TV-VCR cost in the mid-$300s, but a Samsung 32-inch HD was in the low $600s, which didn&#39;t seem unreasonable considering the quality of the picture.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why should we get this?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116936332458762426/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116936332458762426&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116936332458762426'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116936332458762426'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/hdtv.html' title='HDTV'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116935737006902439</id><published>2007-01-21T00:24:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-21T00:29:30.093-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Change sometimes isn&#39;t so fast</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/21/us/21land.large2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/21/us/21land.large2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Angel Franco/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://select.nytimes.com/2007/01/21/us/21land.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yes, the Ill Will Can Be Subtle. Then, One Day, It Isn’t.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By DAN BARRY&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 21, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GREENWOOD, La.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Bullets shattered the peace in the home of Ernest Lampkins, mayor of Greenwood, La. Who did it remains unknown. To Mr. Lampkins, the motive is clear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Midnight in a handsome one-story house on Waterwood Drive. Hours after Ernest and Shirley Lampkins say goodnight to their teenage daughter, Brett, and to the first Sunday of the new year, a Sunday of churchgoing and turkey and chili and some of those sweet frozen grapes that Ernest likes so much. Two bullets pay a call.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They explode through the living room window. They tear through the soft-yellow curtains that Shirley ordered from a catalog. They rocket past the Easter basket containing family snapshots, past Brett’s bedroom door, past Ernest’s antique upright piano, past the framed portrait of father, mother and daughter in serene pose.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One bullet strikes a golden candelabrum and splits: half whistles into a wall near the kitchen; half crashes through a French door — turning smooth glass into a spider’s web of shards — and into the sunroom, four steps from the master bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other bullet slams so hard into the living room wall that it has to be pried out. “It was a piece of lead about the size of my thumb,” Mr. Lampkins recalls. “They use that for killing deer.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are no deer in the Lampkins home. Only Brett, 17, a high school junior, who has just learned to drive and wears slippers that look like kittens. And Shirley, 62, a retired high school English teacher and administrator, who enjoys gardening and makes a delectable fig cake. And Ernest, 78, a retired educator who has a doctorate in ethnomusicology and is known throughout Louisiana for reaching children through music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh. One more thing about Ernest. He is also the mayor here in Greenwood, a quiet town of 2,600 a few miles west of Shreveport. Greenwood has a Dollar General store, a Mexican restaurant and some antebellum homes, including one once used as a Confederate hospital. It is predominantly white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh. And one more thing about the Lampkinses.

Then it does.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the police arrive to interview and to collect the shell casings from the street, it is hard to forget that several days earlier, the black mayor in Westlake, about 230 miles south of here, was found shot to death, and that some people there dispute findings that he killed himself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Running for office can still be deadly for black men.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116935737006902439/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116935737006902439&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116935737006902439'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116935737006902439'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/change-sometimes-isnt-so-fast.html' title='Change sometimes isn&#39;t so fast'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116935686293987776</id><published>2007-01-21T00:12:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-21T00:21:02.973-05:00</updated><title type='text'>More idiocy</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20070120/capt.sge.kcv62.200107205655.photo00.photo.default-405x512.jpg?x=272&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=_uiBPk9MSvD9loOS_vvKgQ--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20070120/capt.sge.kcv62.200107205655.photo00.photo.default-405x512.jpg?x=272&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=_uiBPk9MSvD9loOS_vvKgQ--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhuber.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://zenhuber.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Another Bag of Krauthammers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last Friday, in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/18/AR2007011801509.html&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Washington Post&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; op-ed &quot;A Plausible Plan B,&quot; neoconservative pundit Charles Krauthammer was more openly skeptical of the surge option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;If we were allied with an Iraqi government that, however weak, was truly national -- cross-confessional and dedicated to fighting a two-front war against Baathist insurgents and Shiite militias -- a surge of American troops, together with a change of counterinsurgency strategy, would have a good chance of succeeding. Unfortunately, the Iraqi political process has given us Nouri al-Maliki and his Shiite coalition.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krauthammer is confident that the U.S. troops will acquit themselves admirably (as am I), but that the surge effort &quot;will fail, however, because the Maliki government will undermine it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krauthammer proposes an alternative &quot;Plan B&quot; in which we tell Maliki:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us down, and we dismantle the Green Zone, leave Baghdad and let you jfend for yourself; we keep the airport and certain strategic bases in the area; we &lt;i&gt;redeploy&lt;/i&gt; most of our forces to Kurdistan; we maintain a significant presence in Anbar province, where we are having success in our one-front war against al-Qaeda and the Baathists. Then we watch. You can have your Baghdad civil war without us. [Italics added.]&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Krauthammer&#39;s Plan B sounds very much like Kissinger&#39;s &quot;repositioning&quot; plan, which sounds very much like someone else&#39;s Plan A that&#39;s been on the table for more than a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/pa12_murtha/pr_051117_iraqres.html&quot;&gt;year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the American Army will eat how?

Some voters still associate her most with the controversies of the Clinton administration, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/r/republican_party/index.html?inline=nyt-org&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Republican Party&quot;&gt;Republicans&lt;/a&gt; have long attacked and caricatured her, and plan to brand her as indecisive on Iraq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have never been afraid to stand up for what I believe in or to face down the Republican machine,” Mrs. Clinton said on the Web site. “After nearly $70 million spent against my campaigns in New York and two landslide wins, I can say I know how Washington Republicans think, how they operate, and how to beat them.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, Mrs. Clinton would be the first female nominee of a major American political party, and she would become the first spouse of a former president to seek a return to the White House. President &lt;a href=&quot;http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/bill_clinton/index.html?inline=nyt-per&quot; title=&quot;More articles about Bill Clinton.&quot;&gt;Bill Clinton&lt;/a&gt; left office in 2000 after two terms marked by robust economic expansion and a series of investigation into his personal life and the Clintons’ business dealings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The successes and shadows of those years will likely loom over Mrs. Clinton, who was both a hands-on adviser and a divisive presence in his administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Mrs. Clinton has become a major political figure in her own right: She is broadly popular with women, African-Americans, and other core groups in the Democratic Party, and she is one of the party’s best fundraisers and most sought-after speakers. She is admired by many independents and Republicans in New York, winning re-election last year by 30 points. While she is not associated with any major piece of legislation, she is widely regarded as an effective, thoughtful lawmaker who has built bipartisan ties&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s see.&lt;/p&gt;Only 72 percent of Americans will vote for a woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hilary Clinton is the most detested politician outside of the Bush Administration.&lt;br /&gt;So detested, her name is a punchline in most of America&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She can&#39;t campaign for Dems outside the Far West and Northeast.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has zero legislative accomplishments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She supported the Iraq war&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has no national security experience&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She has no defining political philosophy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the Clinton campaign is a house of cards. When she is pressed hard and expected to actually take controversal stands, she is going to falter. She is a cautious politician, who despite all of her experiences, does not gauge the antipathy she faces on the left and the middle.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There isn&#39;t a chance in hell I would support Clinton, or to be honest, Obama, in a primary at this point. Neither has done more than talk and that will not cut it when we have to salvage our reputation and foreign policy.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116930633567994707/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116930633567994707&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116930633567994707'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116930633567994707'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/yawn-hillarys-in.html' title='Yawn, Hillary&#39;s In'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116930382040640816</id><published>2007-01-20T09:30:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-20T09:37:01.773-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Bush&#39;s plan falling apart</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.realcities.com/images/realcities/krwashington/16502/272325673172.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.realcities.com/images/realcities/krwashington/16502/272325673172.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Tom Lasseter/MCT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;div style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot; class=&quot;photocaption&quot;&gt; Iraqi Army soldiers from the Kurdish-dominated&lt;br /&gt;units in northern Iraq at a base outside of Mosul,&lt;br /&gt; Iraq, December 2005.

One thing they didn&#39;t bank on, they said, was being sent into the &quot;fire&quot; of Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The soldiers don&#39;t know the Arabic language, the Arab tradition, and they don&#39;t have any experience fighting terror,&quot; said Anwar Dolani, a former peshmerga commander who leads the brigade that&#39;s being transferred to Baghdad from the Kurdish city of Sulaimaniyah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dolani called the desertions a &quot;phenomenon&quot; but refused to say how many soldiers have left the army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I can&#39;t deny that a number of soldiers have deserted the army, and it might increase due to the ferocious military operations in Baghdad,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;This is the biggest performance through which we can test them,&quot; said Lt. Gen. Ali Ghaidan, the commander of land forces for the Iraqi Ministry of Defense. The Kurdish soldiers will be using translators, and they&#39;ll start off doing less dangerous tasks, such as manning checkpoints with Arab soldiers, he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In interviews, however, soldiers in Sulaimaniyah expressed loyalty to their Kurdish brethren, not to Iraq. Many said they&#39;d already deserted, and those who are going to Baghdad said they&#39;d flee if the situation there became too difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I joined the army to be a soldier in my homeland, among my people. Not to fight for others who I have nothing to do with,&quot; said Ameen Kareem, 38, who took a week&#39;s leave with other soldiers from his brigade in Irbil and never returned. &quot;I used to fight in the mountains and valleys, not in the streets.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kareem said he knew that deserting was risky, but he said he&#39;d rather be behind bars in Kurdistan than a &quot;soldier in Baghdad&#39;s fire.&quot; Without the language and with his Kurdish features, he was sure he would stand out, he said. He&#39;s a Kurd, he said, and he has no reason to become a target in an Arab war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now he drives a taxi in Sulaimaniyah, eking out a living and praying that he doesn&#39;t get caught.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other soldiers in Sulaimaniyah also said they didn&#39;t want to be involved in someone else&#39;s war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Farman Mohammed, 42, celebrated the Muslim Eid holiday with his family last month and didn&#39;t go back when he heard that he might be deployed to Baghdad. Afraid for his life, he found a new job and settled in with his family.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The fanatic Sunnis in Baghdad kill the Shiites, and vice versa. Both of them are outraged against the Kurds. They will not hesitate to kill us and accuse us of being collaborators with the occupiers,&quot; he said. &quot;How can we face them alone?&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116930382040640816/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116930382040640816&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116930382040640816'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116930382040640816'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/bushs-plan-falling-apart.html' title='Bush&#39;s plan falling apart'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116929438786927812</id><published>2007-01-20T06:53:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-20T06:59:47.903-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Scumbags in action</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/75104/bodyguards.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/606085/bodyguards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/19/AR2007011901673.html&quot;&gt; Iraq Security Contractor Countersues&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By MIKE BAKER&lt;br /&gt;The Associated Press&lt;br /&gt;Friday, January 19, 2007; 9:42 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;RALEIGH, N.C. -- Private security contractor Blackwater USA is seeking $10 million from the attorney representing the estates of four employees killed and mutilated in Iraq, arguing their families breached the security guards&#39; contracts by suing the company for wrongful death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blackwater also has asked a federal court to move the dispute into arbitration, having failed so far in its ongoing efforts to have the lawsuit dismissed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Arbitration is necessary &quot;in order to safeguard both (Blackwater&#39;s) own confidential information as well as sensitive information implicating the interest of the United States at war,&quot; attorneys for Blackwater Security Consulting, a unit of Moyock-based Blackwater USA, wrote in a petition filed December 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Callahan, a California-based attorney representing the families, called the claim &quot;appalling.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;This is a shock-and-awe tactic,&quot; Callahan said Friday. Blackwater&#39;s attorneys declined to comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four families, represented by estates administrator Richard Nordan, filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Blackwater in January 2005 in state court. Family members argue Blackwater broke contractual obligations and used cost-saving measures that ultimately led to the deaths of the four men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blackwater&#39;s counterclaim for $10 million specifically names Nordan and not the estates or the men&#39;s families.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or so their illegal activities can&#39;t be exposed in a court of law.

There were few hints of the fact that, only days before, the neighbourhood had been the scene of violent clashes between rightwing extremists and anti-Nazi protesters - running battles involving gunfire and bombs that might easily have cost lives were it not for the fact that Porcupine does not, in most commonly accepted senses of the term, exist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lesson you quickly learn upon entering the online virtual world of Second Life, however, is that non-existence is less of an impediment than might be supposed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It hasn&#39;t stopped the development of a fully-featured alternative universe in which Second Life&#39;s 2.4 million registered users build houses, set up businesses, form clubs and societies, hold parties and have sex. And it did not prevent protest from spilling over into aggression when the Front National, the far-right French group led by Jean-Marie Le Pen, became the first European political party to open a headquarters within Second Life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The first night I arrived at the protest ... it was ringed on all sides by protesters with signs to wave and statements to distribute,&quot; wrote James Au, whose website, New World Notes, reports on events in Second Life. &quot;By the second night I came ... the conflict had become more literal, for many residents had armed themselves. Multi-coloured explosions and constant gunfire shredded the air of Porcupine.&quot; Some activists threw exploding pigs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;This nationalist idea that Front National is advocating is something that has spread all over Europe like a virus,&quot; a protester, using the name Ichi Jaehun, told Mr Au. &quot;It&#39;s [as if] the history of the 20th century has already been forgotten. It is time to say enough!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A group calling itself Second Life Left Unity issued press releases explaining that it had purchased land next to the Front National office, and would be &quot;manning a protest there until FN go or are ejected. Wherever fascists are, we will ensure they get no peace to corrupt and lie to decent people&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few days later, the Front National building had vanished altogether, leaving only a few protest placards showing Mr Le Pen - who made it through to the final round of the last real-world French presidential election in 2002 - wearing a Hitler moustache.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was probably inevitable that political confrontation would arrive in Second Life in the end. It is already home to one of the most potentially revolutionary developments on the internet in recent years - a vibrant economy in which residents use a virtual currency, Linden dollars, to buy and sell goods and services, including clothes for their online characters, works of art, buildings, and financial advice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because users retain legal ownership of the things they create, and because Linden dollars can be turned into US dollars via an exchange operated by Linden Lab, the company behind Second Life, the virtual-world businesses have real-world value. Numerous real firms have opened outlets in Second Life, and a woman living in Germany has reportedly become its first dollar millionaire - from the property development business she runs inside Second Life.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116929361535900069/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116929361535900069&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116929361535900069'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116929361535900069'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/battle-of-exploding-pigs.html' title='The battle of the exploding pigs'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116929326327135115</id><published>2007-01-20T06:38:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-20T06:41:03.293-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Racial Row on UK show</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/01/20/jadedavina372ready.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2007/01/20/jadedavina372ready.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Jade Goody is interviewed by Davina McCall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;following her eviction from the Celebrity Big &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Brother house. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photograph: Timothy Anderson/Channel 4/PA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://media.guardian.co.uk/site/story/0,,1994828,00.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jade evicted as poll reveals public anger with Channel 4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karen McVeigh and Jeevan Vasagar&lt;br /&gt;Saturday January 20, 2007&lt;br /&gt;The Guardian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Jade Goody was evicted from the Celebrity Big Brother house last night in a vote which could be seen as a public stand against racial intolerance. An overwhelming majority - 82% - of viewers voted against her. In a post-eviction interview, Goody said she was &quot;embarrassed and disgusted&quot; by her own behaviour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 25-year-old from Bermondsey, south-east London, was up for eviction against Shilpa Shetty, a Bollywood actor and the alleged victim of racist abuse from several housemates, especially Goody.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before her departure was announced, an unprecedented 40,000 complaints were made to broadcast regulator Ofcom and the public were urged to &quot;vote for tolerance&quot; by a number of politicians including the chancellor, Gordon Brown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Public anger over the racism row is underlined today by a Guardian/Marketing Sciences poll which shows most people believe Channel 4 should have intervened to stop the abuse of Shetty.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The public does not believe the housemates&#39; behaviour is representative of the country, the poll shows, with 55% believing the insults directed at the Indian housemate were not typical of modern Britain. A quarter say it did reflect society, with more than half of people believing Channel 4 had engineered the clashes to gain viewing figures.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Brown, who was yesterday visiting a Bollywood film studio in Mumbai during his visit to India, presented the choice between Goody and Shetty as one that would shape how the rest of the world sees Britain. &quot;I know that people in India say that Britain is generally a country of tolerance,&quot; Mr Brown said. &quot;It is up to people to cast their votes, but a vote for Britain is a vote for tolerance.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Goody left the house to an eery silence after Channel 4 banned the usual crowds from the eviction show. For once she appeared to pause for thought when presenter Davina McCall told her of the political and diplomatic storm her words had provoked and played back footage of her behaviour. She said that when her comments against Shetty, who she referred as &quot;Shilpa Poppadom&quot;, were read back to her, she thought &quot;Oh my God, maybe I am racist&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She added: &quot;I look like a complete and utter nasty small person - the sort of person I don&#39;t like myself,&quot; but continued: &quot;I am not a racist and I sincerely, with my hand on my heart, apologise to anyone I have offended out there.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Goody was unaware of the effect her words would have, Shetty was not. In one exchange before the eviction, she told Goody she did not think her a racist, but added: &quot;You said it, its going to be out and a lot of Indians heard it. Trust me, it&#39;s not going to go down well.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116929326327135115/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116929326327135115&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116929326327135115'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116929326327135115'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/racial-row-on-uk-show.html' title='Racial Row on UK show'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116929296803891520</id><published>2007-01-20T06:27:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-20T06:36:08.806-05:00</updated><title type='text'>No spanking</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/media/photo/2007-01/27466197.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/media/photo/2007-01/27466197.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;             &lt;div class=&quot;keydeck11&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Anti-spanking: &lt;/b&gt;Jordan Riak, a retired teacher&lt;br /&gt;who calls his 25-year campaign against corporal&lt;br /&gt;punishment and spanking his &quot;life work.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;           &lt;div class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;(Kevin Kerr / For the Times)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://latimes.com/news/local/la-me-spanking20jan20,0,7902292.story?track=tottext&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spanking ban: are we gonna get it?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parents say lawmaker&#39;s plan to outlaw hitting children under 4 smacks of the nanny state.&lt;br /&gt;By Nancy Vogel, Times Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;January 20, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SACRAMENTO — Assemblywoman Sally Lieber hit a nerve when she mused publicly this week about making it illegal for parents to strike children younger than 4.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bay Area Democrat hasn&#39;t introduced a bill yet, but critical calls and e-mails — including some personal attacks — have flooded her offices since her local newspaper wrote about her intention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unbowed, Lieber said she would introduce a bill next week to make California the first state to make the hitting of a toddler or baby a crime. Language was still being drafted, but Lieber was considering making a violation a misdemeanor, punishable by up to a year in county jail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It would get us out of the ridiculous situation of having our law saying there&#39;s justifiable beating of children,&quot; Lieber said, &quot;in the midst of a society where we say we value children and protect them.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Readers of the San Jose Mercury News blasted the idea — &quot;Although I don&#39;t believe in spanking, I sure do not need some media-grubbing politician to tell me how to raise my kids,&quot; wrote one — but Lieber said she was confident that she would win Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger&#39;s support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a Mercury News interview Thursday, Schwarzenegger described how as a child he &quot;got smacked about everything&quot; by his father, but has never spanked his own four children. He questioned how such a law could be enforced, but said he understood the desire to &quot;get rid of the physical, the brutal behavior that some parents have.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Answering questions after delivering a healthcare speech Friday to Los Angeles business leaders, Schwarzenegger said he and his wife, Maria Shriver, quickly found that threatening to ground their children to do schoolwork worked well. &quot;We can discipline the kids … without hitting,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Schwarzenegger&#39;s native Austria banned corporal punishment of children in 1989. Fifteen other nations have done so, most in Europe, according to the nonprofit Center for Effective Discipline in Columbus, Ohio. California is one of 29 states that ban corporal punishment in schools. Most states — including California — ban physical discipline in child-care settings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nadine A. Block, a former school psychologist who 25 years ago began pushing for an end to paddling in schools, said a Wisconsin lawmaker unsuccessfully sought 15 years ago to make all hitting of children illegal. A similar effort failed last year in Massachusetts, she said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the narrower scope of Lieber&#39;s bill and California&#39;s progressive tendency give it better odds of success, said Block, executive director of the Center for Effective Discipline.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Most people know you should not hit babies and babies do not know right from wrong,&quot; she said. &quot;Babies you have to distract, remove, supervise, protect.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieber&#39;s proposal promises to draw national media attention like that triggered in 1994 when then-Assemblyman Mickey Conroy, an Orange County Republican, proposed paddling juvenile graffiti vandals with an 18-by-6-inch wooden paddle. Conroy was sought by dozens of radio talk shows and TV news programs to talk about his bill, which was defeated in committee. Conroy died in 2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieber said she has gotten plenty of encouragement — including from prosecutors — but Mercury News readers rejected the idea in e-mails posted on the newspaper&#39;s website.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The day that the [government] gives birth to my children, then they have a right to raise them,&quot; wrote Esther. &quot;Till then they are mine to do with as I please. I will raise them the way I see fit. If I think that those little butts need a swat … I will be the one to give it to them.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having seen the way some people fetishize violence against their own children, this is a good idea. Sure, a slight tap for a toddler running towards traffic is hardly a crime, but a lot of people need a reminder that they might want to use other methods with their kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We weren&#39;t spanked as kids, my mother wasn&#39;t spanked. We didn&#39;t turn into criminals.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116929296803891520/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116929296803891520&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116929296803891520'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116929296803891520'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/no-spanking.html' title='No spanking'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116928057736588776</id><published>2007-01-20T03:06:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-20T03:09:37.406-05:00</updated><title type='text'>This isn&#39;t in the plans for the Kurds</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/232649/kurdistan.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/112768/kurdistan.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/20/world/middleeast/20oil.html?hp&amp;ex=1169355600&amp;amp;amp;en=3e091311d93ff873&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt; Draft Law Keeps Central Control Over Oil in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By JAMES GLANZ&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 20, 2007&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan. 19 — After months of tense bargaining, a cabinet-level committee has produced a draft law governing Iraq’s vast oil fields that would distribute all revenues through the federal government and grant Baghdad wide powers in exploration, development and awarding major international contracts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The draft, described Friday by several members of the committee, could still change and must be approved by the Iraqi cabinet and Parliament before it becomes law. Negotiations have veered off track in the past, and members of the political and sectarian groups with interest in the law could still object as they read it more closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if approved in anything close to its present form, the law would appear to settle a longstanding debate over whether the oil industry and its revenues should be overseen by the central government or the regions dominated by Kurds in the north and Shiite Arabs in the south, where the richest oil fields are located.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The draft comes down firmly on the side of central oversight, a decision that advocates for Iraq’s unity are likely to trumpet as a triumph. Because control of the oil industry touches so directly on the interests of all Iraq’s warring sectarian groups, and therefore the future of the country, the proposed law has been described as the most critical piece of pending legislation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This will give us the basis of the unity of this country,” said Ali Baban, the Iraqi planning minister and a member of the Sunni-dominated Tawafaq party who serves on the negotiating committee. “We pushed for the center in Baghdad, but we didn’t neglect the Kurds and other regions,” Mr. Baban said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may smile and go along, but the Kurds want Kirkuk and the oil</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116928057736588776/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116928057736588776&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116928057736588776'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116928057736588776'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/this-isnt-in-plans-for-kurds.html' title='This isn&#39;t in the plans for the Kurds'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116926541081826393</id><published>2007-01-20T00:52:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-19T22:57:20.026-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Provoking Sadr</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/197622/muqtada-al-sadr.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/808082/muqtada-al-sadr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070119/ap_on_re_mi_ea/iraq&quot;&gt; Main aide of Muqtada al-Sadr arrested&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By KIM GAMEL, Associated Press Writer Fri Jan 19, 6:33 PM ET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Iraq - U.S. and Iraqi forces swooped into a mosque complex in east Baghdad on Friday and detained a top aide to radical anti-American cleric Muqtada al-Sadr, the latest in a series of operations aimed at eviscerating the leadership of the Mahdi Army militia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The raid drew immediate criticism from the Iraqi government, which complained it had not been consulted. An aide to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who owes his job as Iraqi leader to al-Sadr&#39;s backing, said the operation was not part of a coming joint U.S.-Iraq security drive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under the plan, to which President Bush has committed an additional 21,500 American troops, U.S. commanders have been promised a freer hand against both Sunni insurgents and Shiite militiamen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;There was no coordination with the Iraqi political leadership and this arrest was not part of the new security plan,&quot; Sadiq al-Rikabi, the al-Maliki adviser, told Al-Arabiya television. &quot;Coordination with the Iraqi political leadership is needed before conducting such operations that draw popular reactions.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abdul-Hadi al-Darraji was captured in the early morning raid and his bodyguard was killed in what Abdul-Zahra al-Suweiadi, a senior al-Sadr aide, called a &quot;cowardly act.&quot; Al-Sadr&#39;s office said al-Darraji was media director for the cleric&#39;s political movement and demanded his immediate release.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;America is playing with fire and our patience is beginning to fade,&quot; said Abdul-Razzaq al-Nidawi, an al-Sadr aide in the Shiite holy city of Najaf. &quot;This savage barbarian act will not pass peacefully.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The U.S. military, in a statement that did not name al-Darraji or mention the Mahdi Army by name, said special Iraqi army forces operating with U.S. advisers had &quot;captured a high-level, illegal armed group leader&quot; in Baghdad&#39;s Baladiyat neighborhood, which is adjacent to Sadr City, the Mahdi Army stronghold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Iraqi forces detained him based on credible intelligence that he is the leader of an illegal armed group (involved in) ... the organized kidnapping, torture and murder of Iraqi civilians. The suspect is also reportedly involved in the assassination of numerous Iraqi Security Forces members and government officials,&quot; the U.S. statement said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It said two other suspects were detained for questioning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also Friday, the top American commander in Iraq, Gen. George Casey, said he thought some of the extra troops might return home after a few months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I think it&#39;s probably going to be the summer, late summer, before you get to the point where people in Baghdad feel safe in their neighborhoods,&quot; Casey said at a news conference at Tallil Air Base in southern Iraq with visiting Defense Secretary Robert Gates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asked how long the additional American forces would remain, Casey replied, &quot;I believe the projections are late summer.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first group of extra troops — a brigade of the 82nd Airborne Division — has just arrived in Baghdad, and Gates said it was too early to predict how Bush&#39;s plan for quelling the sectarian violence in the capital will work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Four other brigades are to be sent to Iraq between now and May, assuming the Iraqis follow through on their commitment to bring three additional Iraqi army brigades into Baghdad and to allow raids against all illegal militias.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gates&#39; daylong visit was not announced in advance. The defense chief met with U.S. commanders and their allied counterparts as the Bush troop buildup was encountering widespread opposition in Congress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (news, bio, voting record) said Friday that the Iraq war &quot;is not an obligation of the American people in perpetuity.&quot; The president, she said, &quot;has dug a hole so deep he can&#39;t even see the light on this. It&#39;s a tragedy. It&#39;s a stark blunder.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Democratic support was building around a resolution that would rebuff Bush&#39;s plans for more troops to Iraq, and more Republicans were looking for ways to sign on to the measure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an interview with an Italian newspaper, al-Sadr said the U.S.-Iraqi security crackdown already has begun. And he confirmed reports that 400 Mahdi Army men have been arrested.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The La Repubblica interviewer quoted al-Sadr as saying he feared for his life and stayed on the move constantly. His aides have told The Associated Press he seldom sleeps in the same place for two nights in succession.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al-Sadr said his militias would not fight back immediately because Islam forbids killing during the Muslim holy month of Muharram, which starts Friday for Sunnis and Saturday for Shiites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Let them kill us. For a true believer there is no better moment than this to die: Heaven is ensured,&quot; he was quoted as saying. &quot;After Muharram, we&#39;ll see.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al-Sadr said he is being targeted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;For this reason, I have moved my family to a secure location. I even have had a will drawn up, and I move continuously in a way that only few can know where I am,&quot; he was quoted as saying by La Repubblica. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116926541081826393/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116926541081826393&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116926541081826393'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116926541081826393'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/provoking-sadr.html' title='Provoking Sadr'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116926468947354546</id><published>2007-01-20T00:42:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-19T22:44:49.503-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Jenna writes a book</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/46480/jenna.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/789818/jenna.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usnews.com/usnews/politics/washingtonwhispers/070119/first_twin_jenna_shops_a_book.htm&quot;&gt;First Twin Jenna Shops a Book&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jenna Bush and the First Lady&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You can soon add the title of author to first daughter Jenna Bush&#39;s résumé.

      &lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;     &lt;p&gt;Top Bush administration officials seem to revel in historical analogies, particularly when it comes to the war in Iraq. At different times, the Bush gang has referenced &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/08/20050822-1.html&quot;&gt;Korea&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050702.html&quot;&gt;Revolutionary War&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/05/20050513.html&quot;&gt;WWI&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.whitehouse.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050704.html&quot;&gt;Civil War&lt;/a&gt;. By mid-2005, the president had settled on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/08/30/AR2005083001078.html&quot;&gt;World War II&lt;/a&gt; as a personal favorite.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is especially fond of pointing to history to justify White House decisions. When pressed a few months ago about the failures of the administration’s policies in the Middle East, Rice told reporters, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2147398/&quot;&gt;I’m a student of history&lt;/a&gt;, so perhaps I have a little more patience with enormous change in the international system. It’s a big shifting of tectonic plates, and I don’t expect it to happen in a few days or even in a year.” Apparently, Rice’s detractors just don’t know enough about history to make sound judgments. We should leave it all to &lt;i&gt;Dr.&lt;/i&gt; Rice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;With this in mind, the Wall Street Journal &lt;a href=&quot;http://online.wsj.com/article/SB116917380100681116.html?mod=politics_first_element_hs&quot;&gt;noted&lt;/a&gt; today that when Rice compares today’s challenges in the Middle East to the Cold War and post-World War II Europe, as she does quite frequently, she has no idea what she’s talking about.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her contention is while things may look bad now in Iraq and elsewhere in the region, history is on the administration’s side. She pushed a similar argument to reporters last month. The Middle East is “moving toward something that I am quite certain will not have a full resolution and that you will not be able to fully judge for decades,” she said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Critics dismiss Ms. Rice’s references to the Cold War as both convenient and a sign of her limited frame of reference. The challenges facing Europe in 1946, they say, bear little similarity to those of the Middle East in the 21st century.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The administration’s reservoir of historical analogies seems limited to the 1914-1991 period. And it’s all about Europe,” said Adam Garfinkle, a former Rice speechwriter who edits the foreign-policy journal The American Interest. “No one in a senior position in this administration seems to have even the vaguest notion of modern Middle Eastern history.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;When a Rice speechwriter says the administration’s top officials are clueless, you know it’s bad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, Rice’s misguided perspective, in which she seems to force modern situations into the historical models she’s familiar with, have real consequences. As the WSJ noted, Rice “tends to portray events, particularly the clash between what she calls ‘moderation’ and ‘extremism’ in the Middle East, as driven by huge, almost inevitable forces that make diplomacy impractical, or even irrelevant.” Rice personally fed that notion this week by insisting diplomatic negations had nothing to do with “deal making.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;“There’s a tendency to think about diplomacy as something that is done untethered to the conditions underlying it or the balance underlying it,” she said. “In fact, that’s not the way that it works. You aren’t going to be successful as a diplomat if you don’t understand the strategic context in which you are actually negotiating. It is not deal-making.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Aaron David Miller, a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson Center and former advisor to Secretaries of State from George Schulz to Colin Powell, said Rice’s comments were so misguided, he “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-miller19jan19,0,5375161.story?coll=la-opinion-rightrail&quot;&gt;nearly fell off [his] chair&lt;/a&gt;” when he read them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remember, back in 2000, when candidate George W. Bush said it didn’t matter if he knew anything; what mattered was he’d have top-notch advisors?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116923862138734443/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116923862138734443&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116923862138734443'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116923862138734443'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/no-kidding.html' title='No kidding'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116923823581099265</id><published>2007-01-19T15:18:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-19T15:23:55.906-05:00</updated><title type='text'>She wanted unemployment?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/14913/donkey.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/638602/donkey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070119/NEWS10/301190003/1001&quot;&gt;Diary of a goof-off: No work, no pay &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Des Moines woman details her idling on the job on her employer&#39;s computer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By CLARK KAUFFMAN&lt;br /&gt;REGISTER STAFF WRITER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;January 19, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A Des Moines hotel worker has been fired for using her employer&#39;s computer to keep a massive, detailed journal cataloging her efforts to avoid work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;State records indicate that Emmalee Bauer, 25, of Elkhart was hired by the Sheraton hotel company in February 2005. During most of 2006, she worked at the company&#39;s Army Post Road location as a sales coordinator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;At one point during her employment, Bauer was allegedly instructed to refrain from using company time to work on her personal, handwritten journal. Rather than stop writing at all, Bauer allegedly began using her work computer to keep the journal up to date.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I am going to be typing all my thoughts instead of writing all day,&quot; wrote Bauer, according to portions of the journal that were entered into evidence at a recent state hearing dealing with Bauer&#39;s request for unemployment benefits. &quot;That way, there isn&#39;t any way to tell for sure if I am working really hard or I am just goofing off.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the next several months, Bauer composed a book-length journal of 300 single-spaced pages, describing in excruciating detail her dogged efforts to avoid any sort of work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;This typing thing seems to be doing the trick,&quot; she wrote. &quot;It just looks like I am hard at work on something very important.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A supervisor discovered the journal late last year and fired Bauer for misuse of company time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other journal entries, according to evidence presented at the hearing:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- &quot;I am going to sit right here and play Elf Bowling or some other nonsense. Once lunch is over, I will come right back to writing to piddle away the rest of the afternoon. ... I have almost 100 pages here!

Did she think her bosses weren&#39;t going to keep track of her work?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#39;t do this.

As his mother says, he really hates it here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Semaj can drive a stolen car 90 mph while leading a police chase, as he demonstrated Sunday. The chase ended only after he blew the engine on a 1986 Acura swiped from a neighbor who had left the car unlocked and running. The boy then refused to get out of the car, which he had crashed into a tree.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Police had to break a car window, grab him and take him back to his mother&#39;s apartment in Lakewood, a gritty working-class suburb near Tacoma. This was his third stolen car in the past month, according to his mother, who said he learned how to drive playing video games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The morning after the car crash, Semaj came up with a new, improved runaway scheme -- one that would transport him to Texas free of charge, get him on all-news cable television and prompt a local congressman to ask angry questions about how a kid could outfox a major airline and slip through federal airport security.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early Monday, the boy managed to sneak out of his house and travel about 50 miles to Seattle-Tacoma International Airport. Police speculate he hitched a ride or stole another car.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His mother, Sakinah Booker, who is single and has three other boys, reported him missing at 7:30 a.m., but had no idea where he had gone. She later told reporters that Semaj loathes his life in Washington state, has tried to run away nine times since moving to the region less than a year ago and is &quot;seeking a strong male figure&quot; back in his former home state of Texas. His grandfather lives in Dallas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the Sea-Tac airport, Semaj did not have a reservation, nor did he have a means of buying a ticket. But he single-handedly conned Southwest Airlines and the federal Transportation Security Administration into allowing him to board a flight to San Antonio via Phoenix.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that has annoyed Rep. Norm Dicks (D-Wash.), in whose district Semaj reluctantly lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We have spent millions of dollars and inconvenienced the American public mightily trying to make air travel safe,&quot; Dicks said. &quot;If a 9-year-old can exploit this security system, we are going to have to look into the procedure&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Needs a male authority figure? Seems mom fucked that up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the hell can a 9 year old drive to the airport? How can he leave the house without mom knowing?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#39;s a very bright kid, but he&#39;s gonna kill himself and others because his mom is unable to step in and do her job.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116918914920714913/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116918914920714913&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918914920714913'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918914920714913'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/jesus.html' title='Jesus'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116918814845913525</id><published>2007-01-19T01:24:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-19T01:29:08.530-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Only in Washington</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/18/garden/18dems600.1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/18/garden/18dems600.1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Doug Mills/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/garden/18roomies.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking Power, Sharing Cereal&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SOME of the most powerful Democrats in America are split over a most incendiary household issue: rodents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I once had to pick up a mouse by the tail that Durbin refused to pick up,” complained Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, referring to his roommate Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This characterization is not fair to Mr. Durbin, interjected another tenant in the Capitol Hill row house, Representative Bill Delahunt of Massachusetts. For starters, it overlooks Mr. Durbin’s gift for killing rats. “He will kill them with his bare hands,” Mr. Delahunt marveled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Oh, will you stop with the rats,” said the annoyed fourth roommate, Representative George Miller of California. He owns the house and is sensitive to any suggestion that he harbors pestilence. It’s dicey enough that he harbors politicians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think MTV’s “Real World” with a slovenly cast of Democratic power brokers. While Washington may have more than its share of crash pads for policy-debating workaholics, few, if any, have sheltered a quorum as powerful as this one. About a quarter-mile southeast of the Capitol, the inelegantly decorated two-bedroom house has become an unlikely center of influence in Washington’s changing power grid. It is home to the second- and third-ranking senators in the new Democratic majority (Mr. Durbin, the majority whip, and Mr. Schumer, the vice chairman of the Democratic caucus) and the chairman of the House Democratic Policy Committee (Mr. Miller).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Delahunt, a six-term congressman, is the least prominent of the four but perhaps the funniest. More to the point, he is the only one willing to sleep in the living room with a close-up view of Mr. Schumer slumbering a few feet away in his boxers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Miller began taking in weary lawmakers in 1982, but this is the first time in 12 years that four members of a Democratic majority have lived here simultaneously. The four men were once host to a fund-raiser for Senator Barbara Boxer of California at their divey dwelling, raising $80,000. Given the prevailing attire in the place on many nights, guests were given pairs of custom-made “Barbara Boxer shorts.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a general rule, the abode is hardly fit for entertaining, or even for a health inspector. It is used for convenience: sleeping, ditching stuff, and fast-food consumption — the kinds of functions prized by vagabond politicians whose families are back in their home states and who generally spend only their working weekdays here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Everybody in the world says they’re going to do a television series based on us,” said Mr. Durbin, who was collapsed on the couch on a recent Monday night. Still in a tie, he sipped ice water from a massive Chicago Cubs cup while waiting for the Chinese food to arrive. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116918814845913525/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116918814845913525&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918814845913525'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918814845913525'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/only-in-washington.html' title='Only in Washington'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116918053084134255</id><published>2007-01-19T00:57:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-18T23:22:19.606-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Despite total ignorance, I support this idea</title><content type='html'>&lt;a style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot; onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/453777/scum.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/93034/scum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Giuliani and Kerik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/1/18/212229/782&quot;&gt;Giuliani and Broken Windows&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by HarveyMilk [Subscribe]&lt;br /&gt;Thu Jan 18, 2007 at 06:50:01 PM PST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;In an ongoing series, I want to post diaries that piss off those who cling to the &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; of this site.  Not just for the sake of pissing people off (that&#39;s an added bonus), but to get us to think.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I support the &quot;Broken Windows&quot; theory of law enforcement, and I support how Giuliani carried it out.  It was necessary.  It was effective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t care if a Republican did it.  New York is the better for it, and the whole country would be, too.  So there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a national level, we Democrats were in the opposition forever.  But, opposition is one thing.  All you have to do is cry foul and profess a love of America.  We&#39;re good at that.  But now, we have power.  And all signs point to us having even more power in 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the time for righteous rants is over.  Let&#39;s get to policy.  That&#39;s were you can get into some trouble!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I live in an inner-ring suburb of Detroit, and I work in the City of Detroit (all in Wayne County, Michigan - the third bluest county in the country).  John Conyers is my rep.  I am (in my heart of hearts) a Democratic Socialist, and not simply a &quot;Democrat,&quot; just like Martin Luther King, Jr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the same time, I support law enforcement taking the &quot;Broken Windows&quot; approach.  Is being a &quot;Democratic Socialist&quot; and being an advocate of &quot;Broken Windows&quot; policing a dichotomy?  No.  I&#39;ll attempt to explain why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of days ago, I emerged from my concrete bunker of an office building to take my lunch (I&#39;m a legal assistant).  I encountered a man shitting on a public sidewalk.  I gave him a look of disdain.  He looked at me like I&#39;d done something wrong!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his defense, he appeared to be homeless and desperate.  The good leftist in me knows that that isn&#39;t all his fault. And, every business in the CBD has signs posted saying &quot;Restrooms are for Customers ONLY.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, I couldn&#39;t help but think, if it were me, I&#39;d find an alley, a place behind the dumpster to relieve myself.  I wouldn&#39;t shit in front of everyone, and I wouldn&#39;t dare act like someone else had a problem if I were moving my bowels on public sidewalk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Detroit struggles anyway with its national reputation.  And we currently have the NAIAS in town. You would think law enforcement would stop things like public defocation.  But no.  I walked for six blocks to my destination, hoping that, along the way, I could hip a cop to the fact that someone was dropping the kids off in a public square.  Get the guy some help.  But, no member of law enforcement was to be found.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it will take a good, strong-minded Democrat to fix problems like this.  A Republican looks cruel enforcing public decency - a Democrat wouldn&#39;t.  Maybe a &quot;Nixon Goes to China&quot; thing, on the domestic tip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To be clear, I&#39;m not looking for a &quot;blame the victim&quot; solution, but I AM looking for a &quot;quality of life&quot; solution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I care very much about the downtrodden in our society.  I want to invest in mental health.  But I don&#39;t want to watch someone take a shit in public on my way to get my lunch. And I damn sure won&#39;t put up with the shitter getting aggressive toward me.  Fuck that, with no equivocation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And where I am, we have only Democrats to blame.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you know anything other than Giuliani propeganda about Broken Windows or are you a racist who doesn&#39;t respect the constitution? You can be either. But Broken Windows failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ambiguous.org/robin/word/brokenwindows.html&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is the theory famously expounded by James Q. Wilson and George L. Kelling in an article entitled Broken Windows: The Police and Neighborhood Safety, which appeared in Atlantic Monthly in March 1982. They make the consequences of small-scale neglect very clear and very direct:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A piece of property is abandoned, weeds grow up, a window is smashed. Adults stop scolding rowdy children; the children, emboldened, become more rowdy. Families move out, unattached adults move in. Teenagers gather in front of the corner store. The merchant asks them to move; they refuse. Fights occur. Litter accumulates. People start drinking in front of the grocery; in time, an inebriate slumps to the sidewalk and is allowed to sleep it off. Pedestrians are approached by panhandlers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The theory was that if you arrested people for small crimes, they wouldn&#39;t commit big ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, crime in New York had already been going down because of community policing, where the police worked with the locals. Giuliani, who&#39;s antipathy towards blacks was noted, turned broken windows into a policy which led to extrajudicial murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Broken Windows did was increase the number of blacks and latinos in the system for minor things like drinking outside, while whites would never be stopped, much less arrested for such activity. At one point, 80 percent of New York&#39;s black and latino males had been stopped and frisked. One particular opponent of Giuliani was illegally arrested 26 times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the consequences of Broken Windows created a racial divide which has never been truly healed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Abner Louima&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louima was attending a nightclub in Brooklyn when police approached him and then arrested him. He was then taken into the bathroom, raped and had his rectum destroyed by a plunger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Amadou Diallo&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Diallo was coming home at 2 AM after getting a sandwich from the local deli. Four police stopped him and fired 41 shots at him. No gun was found, no evidence of a crime found. The police officers were aquitted by an Albany County jury, forever casting a pall over relations between the NYPD and the African American community. Extrajudicial murder usually does. The city settled with the Diallo family for several million dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Patrick Dorismond&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting off of work after a couple of drinks in a bar, he&#39;s approached by an undercover police officer. After a scuffle, he is murdered on the street by the NYPD. He had no gun, there was no evidence of any crime committed. The case is not prosecuted. His family settles for several million dollars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was the outcome of Giuliani&#39;s broken windows policing, innocents harassed, others extrajudicially tortured and murdered, a gross violation of civil rights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of looking to police solutions, why not work with the community to provide services for the homeless and petty criminals. People shouldn&#39;t have to die for reaching their wallet&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116918053084134255/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116918053084134255&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918053084134255'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918053084134255'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/despite-total-ignorance-i-support-this.html' title='Despite total ignorance, I support this idea'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116918717670004530</id><published>2007-01-19T00:49:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-19T01:12:56.830-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Gunpoint at Democracy</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/18/world/190_perry.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/18/world/190_perry.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andrea Parhamovich in an undated photograph.&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Parhamovich was killed Wednesday in the&lt;br /&gt; ambush of a convoy in Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/19/world/middleeast/19iraq.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;Ambush Kills an American Teaching Democracy to Iraqis&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By DAMIEN CAVE&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 19, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan. 18 — An American woman killed here on Wednesday when gunmen fired on her convoy of vehicles was ambushed just minutes after leaving the headquarters of a prominent Sunni Arab political party, where she had been teaching a class on democracy, party members said Thursday&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They said the woman — Andrea Parhamovich, 28, of Perry, Ohio — left the party’s fortified compound in western Baghdad around 4 p.m., heading east to her group’s offices outside the Green Zone, when she and her armed guards came under attack from all sides.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Les Campbell, Middle East and North Africa director for the National Democratic Institute, which hired Ms. Parhamovich about three months ago, said that during the fierce firefight, guards tried to escape, fought back, then called for reinforcements from other private security contractors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The attackers — perhaps as many as 30 men, according to witness accounts passed on to Mr. Campbell — used heavy weapons, possibly rocket-propelled grenades, destroying the armored sedan that Ms. Parhamovich was in and killing three of her armed guards: a Croatian, a Hungarian and an Iraqi. Two other security contractors were wounded. The attackers then scattered back into the neighborhood.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saleem Abdullah, a senior member of the Sunni political group, the Iraqi Islamic Party, said that Ms. Parhamovich’s group might have been chosen as a target when it arrived. “It seems that someone, when they saw her in the area, set up an ambush,” he said. “That’s what we think.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Campbell described Ms. Parhamovich as a driven young woman, inspired by politics and a desire to help Iraqis connect with their newly elected government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said she joined the National Democratic Institute, a nonprofit organization based in Washington that has worked in Iraq since 2003, after working for a few months with a similar group in Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“She was an idealistic person who saw an opportunity in Iraq to help, to work with people in Iraq who were interested in democracy and human rights, which is what she cared about,” he said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andi Parhamovich was a former Air America staffer and her death was taken especially hard there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And while I am sympathetic to her friends who grieve her loss, I have to wonder what kind of democracy you can build with mercenaries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does anyone expect an election to take place in Iraq in the next few years?  The National Democratic Institute really, really needs to rethink their field operations in Iraq. She rode into an ambush which would make a SF A team proud. 30 guys came at them guns blazing and killed a bunch of people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now how did that happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you think that a certain shia militia might have had issues with this? That they may have objected to helping a Sunni political party?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the NGO&#39;s who remain need to get a grip on reality. Hiring mercenaries, living in foritified compounds, being ambushed, if not stalked, then ambushed, is not going to help people. It will, however, get people killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brutal reality is that the only voting in Iraq will be to comfirm whoever Sadr chooses as president.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116918717670004530/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116918717670004530&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918717670004530'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918717670004530'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/gunpoint-at-democracy.html' title='Gunpoint at Democracy'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116918411379772976</id><published>2007-01-19T00:33:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-19T00:21:53.826-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Oooops</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

It was a painful family tableau rooted in a hundred tangled details, but one overriding and uncontested reality: 9/11.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometime after the death of Peter V. Genco, a Cantor Fitzgerald bond trader, in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the relationship between the girls’ mother and their late father’s parents went sour. The grandparents, Barbara and Victor Genco, obtained a court order in 2003 allowing them to see the children — under supervision, and for exactly four hours, once each month. In legal documents, the mother accused her in-laws of abuse and neglect, including drinking in front of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And on that Sunday afternoon in December, as described by the grandparents, the girls had apparently had enough of the whole business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We had hoped to be a part of their lives and a link to their father,” Barbara Genco, 69, said in an interview. “We imagined taking them with us to Europe, to Disney World. But it is too painful to see how the children have changed toward us.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This sad tale is not entirely uncommon among families torn by the terrorist attacks. There is no official registry of such separations. One 9/11 family advocate said he had encountered more than 100 conflicts in which aging parents of a World Trade Center victim, desperate to remain connected to the children of their lost offspring, had found themselves in bitter struggles with a surviving spouse who would rather they did not. A mediator who helped negotiate settlements among 9/11 families in the early years after the attacks said 1 in 10 of his cases involved estranged grandparents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few have been to court, where recent laws give grandparents some leverage. Many other grandparents have not. Some have been wise and circumspect in efforts to mend relations with their deceased child’s widow or widower. Some have not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sometimes, the spouse is remarried and just doesn’t have time for Grandma and Grandpa anymore,” said Bill Doyle, who lost his son, Joseph, at the World Trade Center and maintains an e-mail registry of several thousand surviving relatives for the Coalition of 9/11 Families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Sometimes, the spouse and the grandparents had differences about whether to bury or cremate the remains, or about where remains should end up,” Mr. Doyle added. “Or sometimes, there is money at stake. Or the people just never liked each other and it comes to blows over the kids. It can get so ugly, it’s beyond belief.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116918273204012598/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116918273204012598&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918273204012598'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116918273204012598'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/another-911-tragedy.html' title='Another 9/11 tragedy'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116916851047637293</id><published>2007-01-18T19:52:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-18T20:01:50.636-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Yes, you need to apologize, you goddamn redneck bastard</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wnet/aaworld/reference/images/ku_klux_klan.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 250px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.pbs.org/wnet/aaworld/reference/images/ku_klux_klan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;You sure told them nigras&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/01/16/ap/politics/mainD8MMJPOG4.shtml&quot;&gt; Va.

But don&#39;t we have enough people running for president next year?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to CNN&#39;s tabulation, four Democrats are already running. One is exploring. Seven others are thinking about it. The Republican list is even longer. Eight Republicans are exploring. Six are thinking. That makes 26 potential candidates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The editors of The Los Angeles Times think there&#39;s room for one more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Why should Californians have their governor sidelined from the race?&#39;&#39; the Los Angeles Times asked in a January 14 editorial. &quot;And why can&#39;t voters across the country be entrusted to decide for themselves whether the governor of California is sufficiently &#39;American&#39; to earn their vote? It&#39;s insulting really.&#39;&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason is Article II of the United States Constitution which reads, &quot;No person except a natural-born citizen . . . shall be eligible to the Office of President.&#39;&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s in there because John Jay, the presiding officer of the Constitutional Convention, wrote a letter to George Washington in 1787 arguing that the commander-in-chief of the United States Army should not be anyone but a natural-born American. The Founders were worried about ambitious foreigners taking over the country; as in Poland, which -- at the time -- had just been partitioned between Austria, Prussia and Russia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s not exactly a problem for the United States today. Yet the provision remains in the Constitution, barring naturalized citizens like Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright from ever becoming President.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Austrian-born Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amending the Constitution to drop the provision has been proposed before.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 1993 movie, &quot;Demolition Man,&#39;&#39; about a police officer who was cryogenically frozen and thawed out in 2032, it was a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Stop! He was president?&quot; asked the incredulous officer, played by Sylvester Stallone, was when his lieutenant, played by Sandra Bullock, told him to go to the Schwarezenegger Library to gather evidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Yes,&quot; the lieutenant replied. &quot;Even though he was not born in this country, his popularity at the time caused the 61st amendment, which states that even . . . &#39;&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t want to know,&#39;&#39; the officer interrupted. &quot;President?&#39;&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Times canvassed California&#39;s congressional delegation to find out how many would support a Constitutional amendment allowing naturalized citizens to become President. Six out of eight Republicans who responded said &quot;yes.&quot; Democrats were more closely split -- 9 yes, 7 no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 51, 204);&quot;&gt;Jen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 51, 204);&quot;&gt;Yes, I think the President should be born in America. As far as the Rethugs who are supporting changing the Constitution go, let&#39;s see how happy they are when they get their President Hernandez or Garcia.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Bill, it was because the other founding fathers hated Hamilton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe it&#39;s me, but at a time Tom Tancredo wants to strip citizenship from people born in this country, why should California&#39;s idiot governor get a break</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116916610064709302/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116916610064709302&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116916610064709302'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116916610064709302'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/hamilton-rule.html' title='The Hamilton Rule'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116913514392468101</id><published>2007-01-18T10:37:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-18T10:45:43.946-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Time to serve</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070118/2007_01_18t075403_450x291_us_iraq.jpg?x=380&amp;y=245&amp;amp;sig=dfCanl3EqU7ud6ZenR5PAg--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070118/2007_01_18t075403_450x291_us_iraq.jpg?x=380&amp;y=245&amp;amp;sig=dfCanl3EqU7ud6ZenR5PAg--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;(Thaier al-Sudani/Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This was sent to warmonger Peter Beinhart.

However, I am concerned that they are missing something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since Sept. 11, military personnel have enjoyed enthusiastic support from those at home. I personally have received standing ovations at airports, unexpected free meals at restaurants, and many warm handshakes. All of these gestures are much appreciated, especially when we compare this with what returning Vietnam veterans endured. However, if we are to win this war, we will need something more than these gestures. We will need people at home to begin sacrificing too.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The unfortunate truth is that our volunteer force was not designed to handle the monumental task of transforming the Middle East. The stress to our troops is only half the story. The other half is the devastation to our supplies and equipment, and the enormous crisis of military readiness we face when Iraq is over. The system of contractors and corporations we have in place to replace our equipment is very slow, and one of the main reasons our troops die is because our vehicles and gear are inadequate. We need all new equipment designed for this threat, and we need them yesterday. We need civilians to demand this for us because we can&#39;t. Such demand requires civilians to sacrifice their time and energy. In today&#39;s America, it is hard to make those sacrifices. But it is what we need to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Finally, we need young people such as Mr. Lavacari and Mr. Glessing to join the military and help us fight. Talking to veterans and comforting them is great, but in the end, only talk. We need you, Mr. Livacari and Mr. Glessing, to fight for the cause that you say you believe in. That may mean sacrificing your college career for a while or the first few years of your professional career. But it is what we need to win. You invoked the greatest generation in your column. The greatest generation sacrificed greatly. I hope that you will too.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Jordan Curry, GW law student&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Support for leaders must be earned&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The students participating in this Friday&#39;s trip to Walter Reed Hospital ought to be commended. However, a very basic truth is lost on Peter Glessing and Gary Livacari, the two individuals soliciting participation. As the death toll mounts and the sordid truths about this Iraq war are laid bare, the home front is turning its indignation against its leaders rather than its protectors. You don&#39;t see any fewer &quot;Support the Troops&quot; ribbons, only fewer &quot;Bush/Cheney&quot; stickers; that is not a coincidence. A &quot;surge in patriotism&quot; will come about if and only when Americans see a genuine, positive change in the conduct of the leaders who are sending their countrymen into harm&#39;s way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-&lt;em&gt;Alexander Tucciarone, Junior&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OYE Comment: We agree. And President Bush can best earn that support by calling upon his strongest supporters, if qualified, such as Gary Livacari and Peter Glessing, to &lt;strong&gt;Be A Man!

Leonnig and Amy Goldstein&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Staff Writers&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, January 18, 2007; Page A01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To see how small a town Washington really is, drop in on jury selection at the trial of I. Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, where so far nearly every juror candidate seems to have a connection to the players or events surrounding the leak of an undercover CIA officer&#39;s identity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is the software database manager whose wife works as a prosecutor for the Justice Department, and who counts the local U.S. attorney and a top official in Justice&#39;s criminal division as neighbors and friends. A housecleaner who works at the Watergate and knows Condoleezza Rice, not by her title of secretary of state, but as the &quot;lady who lives up on the fifth floor.&quot; And a former Washington Post reporter whose editor was now-Assistant Managing Editor Bob Woodward; he went to barbecues at the house of NBC&#39;s Tim Russert, a neighbor, and just published a book on the CIA and spying&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such is the challenge as U.S. District Judge Reggie B. Walton tries to seat a jury of 12 peers for Vice President Cheney&#39;s former chief of staff, in one of Washington&#39;s biggest trials in years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It has always been difficult to select juries in Washington, where the pool is small compared with the number of trials, and half the people summoned to be jurors don&#39;t even show up. But the star power of the players in this case has complicated matters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Libby is charged with lying to FBI agents and a grand jury investigating the disclosure of CIA officer Valerie Plame&#39;s identity to the media in 2003, shortly after the Iraq war began. He is accused of fabricating a story to conceal the nature of his conversations with reporters and his role in a White House effort to discredit Plame&#39;s husband, a prominent critic of the invasion of Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Defense lawyers for Libby contend that he forgot the details and timing of those conversations amid the crush of his daily workload and believed he had heard about Plame from Russert. Only later, they say, did he remember that he had actually learned her identity from his boss, Cheney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By the end of yesterday&#39;s session, Walton and lawyers for both sides had quizzed 33 potential jurors and excused nine. The 24 remaining in the pool, and others who will be questioned starting this morning, still could be struck by lawyers on either side. Walton said he wanted to complete the selection of 12 jurors and four alternates by the end of today. Jurors cannot be identified by name, under an order from the judge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Members of the government and media elite are the key players and witnesses expected to be called in a case that will often focus on the administration&#39;s justification for war in Iraq. As the slow questioning of potential jurors in Courtroom 16 of the federal court wound through a second day yesterday, it became clear that those celebrities rub shoulders a lot with the regular folks in this 13-mile-wide city of 550,000.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116910340749138099/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116910340749138099&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910340749138099'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910340749138099'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/voir-dire-from-hell.html' title='Voir Dire from hell'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116910303339310654</id><published>2007-01-18T01:45:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-18T01:50:33.410-05:00</updated><title type='text'>A nervous WH</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/555750/Bush%20laughing.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/110706/Bush%20laughing.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ha,ha, fucking ha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070118/ap_on_go_co/us_iraq&quot;&gt; White House tries to avoid Iraq showdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By ANNE FLAHERTY, Associated Press Writer 1 hour, 24 minutes ago&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WASHINGTON - A Senate resolution opposing President Bush&#39;s war plan on&lt;br /&gt;Iraq put the White House and Republican leaders on the defensive Wednesday as they scurried to prevent a trickle of GOP support for the measure from swelling into a deluge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eager to avoid an embarrassing congressional rebuke of the president&#39;s new war strategy, the administration seemed to hint that the effort — led chiefly by Democrats — might somehow be of assistance to terrorists. They also herded GOP skeptics to the White House, where they tried to allay the concerns of Republican lawmakers including Sens. John Warner (news, bio, voting record) of Virginia, Sam Brownback (news, bio, voting record) of Kansas, Norm Coleman (news, bio, voting record) of Minnesota and Susan Collins (news, bio, voting record) of Maine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What message does Congress intend to give?&quot; asked White House spokesman Tony Snow. &quot;And who does it think the audience is? Is the audience merely the president? Is it the voting American public or, in an age of instant communication, is it also al-Qaida?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Initially announced by Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin (news, bio, voting record), D-Mich., and possible 2008 presidential candidates Sens. Joseph Biden (news, bio, voting record), D-Del., and Chuck Hagel (news, bio, voting record), R-Neb., the non-binding resolution states that &quot;escalating the United States military force presence in Iraq&quot; is not in the national interest. Bush has proposed adding 21,500 U.S. troops to the roughly 132,000 already in the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moderate Sen. Olympia Snowe (news, bio, voting record), R-Maine, also quickly signed on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hagel&#39;s and Snowe&#39;s support for the measure is a major victory for Democrats, who believe their support will open the door for other Republicans to jump on board and challenge Bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resolution does not call for a withdrawal of troops or threaten funding of military operations, as many Democrats have suggested. Instead, it says the U.S. should transfer responsibility to the Iraqis &quot;under an appropriately expedited timeline&quot; that is not specified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Republicans who attended the White House meetings said they emerged unconvinced more troops were the answer in Iraq, but were unsure whether signing on to the resolution was the answer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is the WH nervous?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because those who vote for the resolution today will be voting on impeachment tomorrow. Abu Ghraib Gonzalez isn&#39;t backing down for no reason. The WH expects a confrontation with Congress, a real one, and it isn&#39;t liking the numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Maliki isn&#39;t acting like a puppet or grateful any longer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The resolution fight is just the opening round for Bush and if he loses it, he&#39;s gonna lose more.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116910303339310654/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116910303339310654&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910303339310654'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910303339310654'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/nervous-wh.html' title='A nervous WH'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116910263516663742</id><published>2007-01-18T01:42:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-18T01:43:55.183-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Simple point</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/877799/19WoundedSoldiers.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/999259/19WoundedSoldiers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Opposing the war is not a &quot;left&quot; position.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an American position</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116910263516663742/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116910263516663742&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910263516663742'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910263516663742'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/simple-point.html' title='Simple point'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116910243829082875</id><published>2007-01-18T01:38:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-18T01:40:38.306-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Fading away</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/18/world/600_mahdi.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/18/world/600_mahdi.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Johan Spanner for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Members of the Mahdi Army set up checkpoints&lt;br /&gt;in Shiite neighborhoods like Topchi, in Baghdad,&lt;br /&gt;but melt away when American patrols pass by.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/18/world/middleeast/18mahdi.html?hp&amp;ex=1169182800&amp;amp;en=e53ee2361c931ca2&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt;Shiite Fighters Arrested in Crackdown, Iraq Says&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By SABRINA TAVERNISE&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 18, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan. 17 — Facing intense pressure from the Bush administration to show progress in securing Iraq, senior Iraqi officials announced Wednesday that they had moved against the country’s most powerful Shiite militia, arresting several dozen senior members in the past few weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was the first time the Shiite government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki had claimed significant action against the militia, the Mahdi Army, one of the most intractable problems facing his administration. The militia’s leader, the cleric Moktada al-Sadr, helped put Mr. Maliki in power, but pressure to crack down on the group has mounted as its killings in the capital have driven a wedge into efforts to keep the country together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the announcement seemed timed to deflect growing scrutiny by an American administration that has grown increasingly frustrated with Mr. Maliki, American officers here offered some support for the government’s claims, saying that at least half a dozen senior militia leaders had been taken into custody in recent weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In perhaps the most surprising development, the Americans said, none of the members had been prematurely released, a chronic problem as this government has frequently shielded Shiite fighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There was definitely a change in attitudes,” in the past three to four weeks, a senior American military officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Maliki, in a meeting with foreign journalists on Wednesday, said 400 Mahdi militiamen had been arrested “within the last few days.” A senior government official said later by telephone that the total number arrested was 420 and that they had been detained in 56 operations beginning in October. Several dozen senior leaders have been detained in the past several weeks, the senior official said on condition of anonymity. He said the total number of senior commanders did not exceed 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, some American military officials remained skeptical that the effort was more than just a short-term attempt to appease them at a time when American government support for Mr. Maliki appeared to have sunk to an all-time low.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Sadr didn&#39;t approve, they would not be there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He wants the Americans to move first.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116910243829082875/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116910243829082875&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910243829082875'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910243829082875'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/fading-away.html' title='Fading away'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116910214877219359</id><published>2007-01-18T01:33:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-18T01:35:48.790-05:00</updated><title type='text'>We oppose the war</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/544420/05ramadi_greensmoke.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/59772/05ramadi_greensmoke.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin Drum has the following up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_01/010578.php&quot;&gt;LATEST POLL DATA&lt;/a&gt;....Public support for the war has pretty much cratered:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   As he seeks to chart a new course in Iraq, Bush also faces pervasive resistance and skepticism toward the U.S. commitment -- more than three-fifths [62%] of those surveyed said the war was not worth fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   ....Asked about Bush&#39;s recent announcement that he would dispatch another 21,500 troops to Iraq, three-fifths [60%] said they opposed the move, while just over one-third [36%] backed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   ....A narrow majority -- 51% -- want Congress to try to block Bush from sending more troops to Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   ....Americans divide in similar proportions when asked whether Congress should attempt to require Bush &quot;to begin withdrawing the troops already in Iraq.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Exactly half said Congress should take steps to begin removing troops (42% opposed such an effort).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Somebody remind me.

Five senior staff members, including Cal Morgan, editorial director of the imprint, will move to the New York office of HarperCollins, while the publicity director, Suzanne Wickham, will remain in Los Angeles, along with her assistant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 10 employees were notified yesterday that they would be laid off, said Michael Morrison, the president and group publisher of HarperMorrow, a division of HarperCollins, in a telephone interview.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The announcement came about a month after Ms. Regan was fired. The publishing house hinted then that the ReganBooks imprint’s days were numbered, saying in a statement that “future decisions relating to the imprint name or the publication of unpublished books will be addressed at the appropriate time.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“From Day 1, we knew we could not be continuing with that name,” Mr. Morrison said. “We didn’t want to, nor could we.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116910179702938988/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116910179702938988&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910179702938988'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116910179702938988'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/thank-you-jesus.html' title='Thank you, Jesus'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116909069064886168</id><published>2007-01-18T00:22:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-17T22:26:42.076-05:00</updated><title type='text'>We&#39;re playing you</title><content type='html'>&lt;a style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot; onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/962879/mahdi%20army.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/837808/mahdi%20army.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Yes, we need guns so we can ethnically cleanse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Baghdad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,3-2553148,00.html&quot;&gt;Give us guns – and troops can go, says Iraqi leader&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stephen Farrell in Baghdad&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;America’s refusal to give Baghdad’s security forces sufficient guns and equipment has cost a great number of lives, the Iraqi Prime Minister said yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nouri al-Maliki said the insurgency had been bloodier and prolonged because Washington had refused to part with equipment. If it released the necessary arms, US forces could “drastically” cut their numbers in three to six months, he told The Times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a sign of the tense relations with Washington, he chided the US for suggesting his Government was living on “borrowed time”. Such criticism boosted Iraq’s extremists, he said, and was more a reflection of “some kind of crisis situation” in Washington after the Republicans’ midterm election losses. Mr al-Maliki conceded that his administration had made mistakes over the hanging of Saddam Hussein. But he refused to accept all criticism over the execution. When asked about the Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi’s attack on Iraq’s capital punishment laws, Mr al-&lt;br /&gt;Maliki cited the Italians’ summary killing of Benito Mussolini and his stringing-up from a lamppost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asked how long Iraq would require US troops, Mr al-Maliki said: “If we succeed in implementing the agreement between us to speed up the equipping and providing weapons to our military forces, I think that within three to six months our need for American troops will dramatically go down. That is on condition that there are real, strong efforts to support our military forces and equipping and arming them.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116909069064886168/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116909069064886168&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116909069064886168'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116909069064886168'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/were-playing-you.html' title='We&#39;re playing you'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116908232073912020</id><published>2007-01-17T19:55:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-17T20:05:20.946-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Idiot</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20070117/i/r2239868489.jpg?x=249&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=bUA4OcIqF2DQ9Ax3zY8i0Q--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20070117/i/r2239868489.jpg?x=249&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=bUA4OcIqF2DQ9Ax3zY8i0Q--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bill, meet a real bear&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mediamatters.org/items/200701170009&quot;&gt;O&#39;Reilly: Abducted child &quot;liked ... his circumstances,&quot; had &quot;a lot more fun&quot; than usual&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;    &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the January 15 edition of Fox News&#39; &lt;i&gt;The O&#39;Reilly Factor&lt;/i&gt;, host &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediamatters.org/issues_topics/people/billoreilly&quot;&gt;Bill O&#39;Reilly&lt;/a&gt; said of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/13/AR2007011300211.html?nav=rss_nation&quot;&gt;Shawn Hornbeck&lt;/a&gt; -- who was abducted at the age of 11, held for four years, and recently found in Missouri -- that &quot;there was an element here that this kid liked about this circumstances&quot; and that he &quot;do[esn&#39;t] buy&quot; &quot;the &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediamatters.org/rd?http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=24038&quot;&gt;Stockholm syndrome&lt;/a&gt; thing.&quot; O&#39;Reilly also said: &quot;The situation here for this kid looks to me to be a lot more fun than what he had under his old parents. He didn&#39;t have to go to school. He could run around and do whatever he wanted.&quot; When fellow Fox News host Greta Van Susteren pointed out that &quot;[s]ome kids like school,&quot; O&#39;Reilly replied: &quot;Well, I don&#39;t believe this kid did.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The following day, during his &quot;Talking Points Memo&quot; segment, O&#39;Reilly responded to viewer mail criticizing his comments about Hornbeck. O&#39;Reilly concluded: &quot;I hope he did not make a conscious decision to accept his captivity because&quot; his kidnapper &quot;made things easy for him. No school, play all day long.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O&#39;Reilly frequently casts himself as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediamatters.org/items/200605030001&quot;&gt;champion&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;a href=&quot;http://mediamatters.org/items/200509140009&quot;&gt;children&lt;/a&gt;.

I actually hope I&#39;m wrong about Shawn Hornbeck. &lt;b&gt;I hope he did not make a conscious decision to accept his captivity because Devlin made things easy for him. No school, play all day long.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;But to just chalk this up to brainwashing and walk away is turning away from the true danger of child molesters and abductors. All American children must be taught survival skills, must be prepared to face crisis situations. That is the lesson of the Shawn Hornbeck story. And that&#39;s the &quot;Memo.&quot; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;From the January 15 edition of Fox News&#39; &lt;i&gt;The O&#39;Reilly Factor&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O&#39;REILLY: &quot;Impact&quot; segment tonight, the disturbing case of the two kidnapped boys in Missouri. As you know, police found 15-year-old Shawn Hornbeck in an apartment of 41-year-old Michael Devlin last week, along with 13-year-old Ben Ownby. Both boys allegedly had been kidnapped by Devlin, who ran a pizza place in the town of Kirkwood. Shawn had been missing for four years. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;And the question is, why didn&#39;t he escape when he could have?&lt;/b&gt; There are all kinds of theories about that. Joining us now from Washington, Greta Van Susteren, who has been out to Missouri reporting on the case.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;All right, you know, the Stockholm syndrome thing, I don&#39;t buy it. I&#39;ve never bought it. I didn&#39;t think it happened in the Patty Hearst case. I don&#39;t think it happened here.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[...] &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O&#39;REILLY: I&#39;m not buying this. If you&#39;re 11 years old or 12 years old, 13, and you have a strong bond with your family, OK, even if the guy threatens you, this and that, you&#39;re riding your bike around, you got friends. The kid didn&#39;t go to school. There&#39;s all kinds of stuff. If you can get away, you get away. All right? If you&#39;re 11. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[...] &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O&#39;REILLY: This is what I believe happened in the Hearst case and in this case. The situation that Hearst found herself in was exciting. She had a boring life. She was a child of privilege. All of a sudden, she&#39;s in with a bunch of charismatic thugs, and she enjoyed it. &lt;b&gt;The situation here for this kid looks to me to be a lot more fun than what he had under his old parents. He didn&#39;t have to go to school. He could run around and do whatever he wanted.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;VAN SUSTEREN: Some kids like school. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O&#39;REILLY: What? &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;VAN SUSTEREN: Some kids like school. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O&#39;REILLY: &lt;b&gt;Well, I don&#39;t believe this kid did. And I think when it all comes down, what&#39;s going to happen is, there was an element here that this kid liked about his circumstances.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;[...] &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;VAN SUSTEREN: So you&#39;re playing that same sort of thinking to this 11-year-old to 15-year-old. You&#39;re thinking logically. You think to yourself, &quot;Why didn&#39;t he leave?&quot; That&#39;s what most people think. Frankly, I had that thought as well. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;But I think you&#39;ve got to remember that this is a child.&lt;/b&gt; He doesn&#39;t -- you know, for whatever reason, he may have, you know, wanted to be with his kidnapper. &lt;b&gt;Maybe his kidnapper turned out to be, quote, &quot;a nice guy&quot; or whatever.&lt;/b&gt; But this is a kid, Bill. &lt;b&gt;And I think we&#39;ve got to wait till we get all the facts&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O&#39;REILLY: All right. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;VAN SUSTEREN: &lt;b&gt;It may turn out -- you may turn out to be right. I don&#39;t know.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O&#39;REILLY: &lt;b&gt;I usually do. I usually -- that usually is what happens.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;VAN SUSTEREN: Especially when you&#39;re the jury. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;O&#39;REILLY: If I&#39;m wrong, Greta, I&#39;ll -- you know, we&#39;ll play this tape and you&#39;ll get your points. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;VAN SUSTEREN: At this point, I simply don&#39;t know. But I&#39;ll wait for the facts. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  O&#39;REILLY: All right. Greta will have more, &lt;i&gt;On the Record&lt;/i&gt;, 10 Eastern. Thanks, Greta, as always. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;This is bullshit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that freak had to do was say he was going to kill his family and that&#39;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fucking idiot O&#39;Reilly</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116908232073912020/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116908232073912020&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116908232073912020'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116908232073912020'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/idiot.html' title='Idiot'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116907340688914485</id><published>2007-01-17T17:31:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-17T17:36:47.096-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Libby on trial</title><content type='html'>FDL and the Huffington Post are doing daily coverage of the Libby trial.

There is nothing you can say that would make me feel positively about President Bush.&quot;*&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thus spake the eighth of nine prospective jurors reviewed by Judge Reggie Walton, Prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald and defense attorneys Ted Wells and William Jeffress today.  She had indicated on her juror form she had some strong opinions about the Bush administration, and, queried in her turn by Judge Walton, she cast her eye over all assembled in the courtroom and declared herself.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;So, you are saying you do not believe you could render a fair and impartial verdict in this case, based on the evidence and according to my instructions to the jury prior to deliberations?,&quot; Judge Walton followed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;That&#39;s right,&quot; she responded, whereupon she was immediately excused from jury duty.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The juror who preceded her took a bit longer, with much questioning and circling around questioning by Mr. Wells, before confessing that, though he would like to think otherwise, it is likely the case that his opinion of Vice President Cheney&#39;s credibility is so low that, were sworn testimony offered by Cheney to be contradicted by another witness, the prospective juror would be hard pressed not the feel predisposed to find the vice president unbelievable.  This juror, of the nine reviewed today, actually knew the most about the backstory of the case, even to the point of naming Richard Armitage as the first to leak Valerie Plame&#39;s identity as a CIA agent. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;To assess the tenor of the news coverage this juror had previously read, Ted Wells asked this juror if he reads blogs.  &quot;Yes,&quot; he replied.  &quot;Which ones?&quot; asked Wells.  &quot;Andrew Sullivan.  Time.  Wonkette.  Powerline, occasionally, and the Huffington Post, occasionally (hello to you, dude!). . . Some of them are pretty good. I stay away from the crazies.” The media room erupted in laughter, as I took a seated bow.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He was excused from the jury for his admission that he could not assure the court his assessment of the vice president would not color his thinking about testimony and evidence.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Therein lies the challenge for Team Libby:  of the nine jurors reviewed in depth today, three were excused.  Two I&#39;ve described to you, and one was excused due to the demands on her time of her work commitments as a free lance contractor paying the rent month to month.  What&#39;s telling is this:  no jurors were excused for cause based on any predispositions that might prejudice them against the prosecution.  Just the defense.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Libby has a war problem, and though this case is narrowly about felony charges of obstruction of justice and perjury, wherein the case for war in Iraq provides only the setting, the unavoidable drama and context of this case is the case made for war in Iraq and the credibility of this administration, and in particular, the Office of the Vice President. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The national polls are what they are.  The president is wildly unpopular and growing more so with his every subsequent utterance; Dick Cheney is even less popular than President Bush.  The public overwhelmingly is rejecting the administration&#39;s policies and reluctantly coming to the conclusion that, at best, the administration innocently provided bad information to the country, but is intransigent in the face of developing reality.  And through all this, to attempt to get a fair trial, Team Libby must scratch to find jurors without strong opinions or preconceptions on these matters, in Washington, DC, of all places&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; (more than one potential juror, when asked if they had heard or read of any controversy alleging the administration had provided the country with bad information in making its case for war, replied, &quot;In this town?  Are you kidding?&quot;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Libby team&#39;s jury selection strategy seems rather clear:  if they can find at least one, and preferably two, people who are among that 12% of the population in support of the administration&#39;s &quot;surge&quot; strategy to escalate the war in the Middle East, that would be golden.  Two such people, or at least one, could possibly hold out against what otherwise might be a consensus to convict, possibly even nullifying the jury, if it came to that.  Generally, the demographics that hurt the administration hurt the defense team:  women (especially single women), minorities, working people or union members, liberal professionals, etc.  &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The problem for team Libby is, their best jurors live in Salt Lake City, not Washington, DC&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Patrick Fitzgerald has a reputation for not making a big fuss over jurors during jury selection, and he lived up (down?) to that reputation today.  He is mostly content to take people at their word if they say they believe they can render a fair and impartial judgment based on the evidence and according to the Judge&#39;s instructions.  He seems most likely to verify that those with previous experience or exposure to the criminal justice system (as victims of crime, or who have family members of those who are policeman, etc.) believe they possess no strong biases or opinions based on those connections or experiences that might render them unable to deliberate in good faith.  He can also be slyly charming.  As one woman mentioned she has three children, Fitzgerald responded, &quot;I take it these are young children?&quot;  Instantly, and with a southern twang, the woman countered, &quot;Oh, aren&#39;t you&lt;em&gt; sweet!&lt;/em&gt;&quot;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Libby team is far more intent and active in its questioning of potential jurors.  Beyond probing about any preconceptions potential jurors might possess related to the administration or the vice president, Wells and Jeffress seem regularly to ask about people&#39;s opinions of Tim Russert.  Clearly, they seem worried about anyone who might be predisposed to think so highly of Russert that, when the time comes for his testimony to contradict Libby&#39;s statements, prospective jurors may reflexively side with Russert. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Team Libby furthermore seems very concerned about the news accounts people have read, as is understandable, given the profile of this case.  What&#39;s more, Libby&#39;s lawyers regularly ask pro forma questions about the possibility of forgetting things, and about the possibility that different accounts of past events could be due to bad recollections held in good faith.  Their questions are so mundane, however, it seems to me as if they are just using the questions to presell their case, a foretaste of the closing  defense argument.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the end, there will be a jury empaneled, and though the pace of juror review slogged along slowly today, the people at the courthouse seem to think we&#39;ll be done by Thursday.  If today is any indication, the best Team Libby can hope for would be jurors who can give them a fair shake, enough of whom may have enough trust and faith in the president and the vice president to trust that their ex-employee, Irving &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby, is telling the truth.  Today&#39;s jurors don&#39;t seem to show signs of being among those true believers in the administration&#39;s aggressive war policies, but then again, you never know with a jury, and people can and do surprise you.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tomorrow, we go through another round of jury selection, and we&#39;ll know more about the potential jury pool.

It&#39;s kind of like worrying if your boss wears pink socks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The power of people on the Internet is that they can act to preserve their own interests. The Internet is a tool which makes communication easier. It isn&#39;t a panacea nor does it create its own structures. The only value of the net, for most people, is a way to make connections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until very recently, there was a lot of concern about the engagement of the American people in politics. They didn&#39;t vote, they weren&#39;t interested in politics. But technology can liberate and strengthen people because they can work together without the endless debate which occurs in meetings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It also allows for goal-centered activism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I think Chris doesn&#39;t get, or a lot of the younger people who blog is this: they don&#39;t like outsiders. Look at the structure of liberal activist groups. By their hiring practices, they exclude the average American. These people have invested their careers in this structure and have benefitted from it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last thing they want to deal with is an Ohio housewife who wants a voice in national politics. They want to tell her what to think, not to listen to her ideas. She isn&#39;t a member of the club, no matter how smart she is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have people who&#39;s recent record makes the Knicks look like champions attacking what has worked. They have a better way for you to succeed when you have and they haven&#39;t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The whole canard of anti-intellectualism is basically &quot;Shut up, meathead&quot; for the 21st Century. Because it isn&#39;t an intellectual argument, but one of class. You&#39;re stupid because you are not part of them. Not because your arguments make no sense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What these people are afraid of is a loss of status. When average people start taking a role in politics and are successful at it, they lose the mojo they have created. If someone in Seattle writes better than Joe Klein, why does Joe Klein still have a job? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So they seek to diminish the effectiveness of the Netroots to attack it&#39;s credibility and keep their own status intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, most people empowered by the Internet could give a fuck what these people think. They failed so badly that these people had to do for themselves what others couldn&#39;t. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let them have their silly arguments while people change the world around them.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116906756803377080/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116906756803377080&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116906756803377080'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116906756803377080'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-are-people-afraid-of.html' title='What are people afraid of?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116904671076027554</id><published>2007-01-17T09:58:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-17T10:11:51.406-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The Car Wreck of American TV</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://us.news3.yimg.com/ca.yimg.com/p/070116/reuters/mtfh90833nootri68987980.jpg?x=380&amp;y=261&amp;amp;sig=7I5DetfWX8dsXo2RYzD9cw--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://us.news3.yimg.com/ca.yimg.com/p/070116/reuters/mtfh90833nootri68987980.jpg?x=380&amp;y=261&amp;amp;sig=7I5DetfWX8dsXo2RYzD9cw--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;These people mostly suck&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/17/AR2007011700094_pf.html&quot;&gt; &#39;Idol&#39;s&#39; Trying Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Lisa de Moraes&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, January 17, 2007; C01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early audition episodes on &quot;American Idol&quot; are the torture camp of show business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We feel really bad about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we like to watch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judges Randy Jackson, Simon Cowell and Paula Abdul are back with their bag of ego deflators. Only this time, Jackson is the bad cop, Simon is the good cop, and Abdul appears to be all sober and normal and obeying the Geneva Conventions. What fun is that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Singing star/poet Jewel is guest-judging; she&#39;s sitting next to Jackson, who told the press a few days ago he thinks the guest judges are hooey and shouldn&#39;t be mixing it up with the three regulars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The judges jump right in, bringing &quot;Idol&quot; wannabe Jessica Rhode to tears.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t want to patronize you but it&#39;s never gonna work for you, darling,&quot; Simon sneers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I&#39;m sorry but we&#39;re trying to find the best, and that was so far away from it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Oh my God!&quot; Rhode wails.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;No way. Please no, please!&quot; she begs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The good news is today you found out you&#39;re not going to be [a singer] so you can just -- move on,&quot; Simon says therapeutically while she weeps.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rhode seeks comfort from her family outside. &quot;I really thought I had it. I thought I was ready. They said I&#39;m not even a good singer,&quot; she sobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Urban Amish, Troy Benham, follows. He&#39;s never seen &quot;American Idol,&quot; does not own a &quot;broadcast television setup in my home.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He sings them a song that involves spit dripping into someone&#39;s face. And roaches. We&#39;re not familiar with that tune.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The judges begin to lacerate him; he puts up a good fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t say I was great. I didn&#39;t say I was the best and I certainly didn&#39;t say I was the next American Idol,&quot; Benham says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, Jesse Holloway walks out midway through his audition, saying he&#39;s &quot;real nervous right now.&quot; He takes a drink and returns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Why did you come back into the room?&quot; Simon asks. &quot;When you left, for once we were on the same page.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Outside the audtion room, Jesse unloads, saying Randy &quot;needs to wipe off the damned makeup he&#39;s got on his face.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is funny, because we were thinking that Randy was looking much prettier this season for reasons we could not explain. Thank you, Jesse Holloway, for providing answers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;When was the last time Paula made a record?&quot; Holloway continues, now on a roll. &quot;They can kiss my [heinie]. They need to be fired because they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was in high school, I sang in my school choir. My younger sister took piano an voice. We love this. Most people have no clue that they suck. And some are unclear that this is a contest to spend a million on you. Dressing like Apollo Creed does not inspire confidence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what I like most about this is the way it shows how little people know about themselves and their abilities. Off key, out of tune, poor Jewel looked like she was being tortured. Most people have no idea of what it takes to b a professional singer. No idea at all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And it&#39;s amusing to watch. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you have to keep in mind, they do find a winner.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116904671076027554/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116904671076027554&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116904671076027554'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116904671076027554'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/car-wreck-of-american-tv.html' title='The Car Wreck of American TV'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116904227525895772</id><published>2007-01-17T08:16:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-17T08:57:56.116-05:00</updated><title type='text'>A history lesson</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1955/1101550620_400.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1955/1101550620_400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Walter Reuther&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find fantasists like Max Sawicky amusing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They talk about some never never land where people did things right and how we should all just repeat what they did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New Left was a minor participant in social change because it was disconnected from the masses. It was really college kids and some activists reading Marx and talking. I&#39;ve read Marx. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll get back the hours I spent pouring through Das Kapital. How that helps fund a charter school is beyond me, but practical results often elude the current left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For someone so contemptuous of people acting on their own, and waiting for the next leader, I think we need to discuss when being on the left wasn&#39;t what people did in dorm rooms and meeting halls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There has probably been no more effective leftist in American history than Walter Reuther. The head of the UAW in the 1930&#39;s and 40&#39;s, he didn&#39;t debate Marx, he fought union goons in the streets of Detroit. He didn&#39;t have theories, but practical goals which improved people&#39;s lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t think Max, with his romance with the words of the New Left, would be able to identify the  most critical adjustments to the class structure in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GI Bill and the UAW contract of 1946. Both built the structure of modern American society in the face of conservative opposition. It was the determination to provide the benefits of the GI Bill, a college education or a home, which changed America. The UAW contract of 1946 established the benefits we now take for granted, vacation, 8 hour work day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, you can sit in a room and read Marx, or you can actually organize and lead people. Harry Bridges was as left as you could get and he spent his time organizing dock workers in the face of goons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The netroots represents the left which actually does something, not the circle jerk of academics and the isolation from the working class which doomed so many of the New Left&#39;s ideas.&lt;br /&gt;Which is why it scares people. The fact is that left academics no more like housewives in politics than the right think tankers. They don&#39;t feel these people are worthy because they haven&#39;t read Marx. Changing lives? Not so important. Doctrinare leftist thought, important.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poor Max thinks it&#39;s important that people read Marx and Marcuse.  How many people did his new left heroes actually elect to office? Because that is how we make change in this country. They were beyond electoral politics. They thought they could convince the poor of their ways by quoting authors they never cared about.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; What Max will realize about his version of the left is that it never does anything. I don&#39;t care if the local activists read Malcolm X. If they stop a landfill in their neighborhood, I think they&#39;ve done more to prove collective action works.  Then he lauds the &quot;direct action forces&quot; the people who disrupt Davos and other gatherings. And that, my friend, is where the romance of the New Left runs into reality. You don&#39;t think most of those groups are infiltrated by everyone from SISMI to the Bundespolizei to MI6?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While they&#39;re hopping around and getting arrested, they are quickly shoved aside as theater. They may have mobilized, but their arrest record is longer than their accomplishments. But that is what happens when you see politics in romantic instead of practical terms. Protest is less important than controlling who sits in government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that the only place his version of the left has worked is in a conference room. Most people have neither the time nor tolerance for it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116904227525895772/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116904227525895772&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116904227525895772'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116904227525895772'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/history-lesson.html' title='A history lesson'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116903951953289670</id><published>2007-01-17T08:02:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-17T09:02:41.250-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The war was wrong</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/756790/Free-French-43-01.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/220829/Free-French-43-01.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kevin Drum, in trying to defend his support for the debable in Iraq when it started, makes an especially &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2007_01/010569.php&quot;&gt;stupid&lt;/a&gt; analogy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m not sure I see it. The fact that Iraq is a clusterfuck doesn&#39;t demonstrate that preemptive war is wrong any more than WWII demonstrated that wars using Sherman tanks are right. It&#39;s the wrong unit of analysis. After all, Iraq didn&#39;t fail because it was preemptive (though that didn&#39;t help); it failed either because George Bush is incompetent or because militarized nation building in the 21st century is doomed to failure no matter who does it. Preemption &lt;em&gt;per se&lt;/em&gt; had very little to do with it, and the argument against preemptive war, which is as much moral as pragmatic, is pretty much the same today as it was in 2002. &lt;/blockquote&gt;Kevin, Irvine has some really nice book stores. I suggest you hit them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, using Shermans was wrong in WWII because they were death traps. But there was no other tank. So people fought and died in them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, Iraq failed because ALL colonial wars fail. Stanley Karnow, Bernard Fall, Alistair Horne all have wonderful books which make this point. The Osprey series of monographs also help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But colonial warfare, whether you call it preemption or mission civilitrice, ends the same, with the locals trying to kill you.  If you read Thomas Pakenham, you would think colonial wars ended when the Europeans established colonies, but they never did. There was always a local rebellion or something until the Europeans left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iraq failed because the US wanted to impose a government on the Iraqi people and they would rather follow Moqtada Sadr.  We could have predicted this, if we chose to. We did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The war was wrong in 2002 and is wrong today.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116903951953289670/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116903951953289670&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116903951953289670'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116903951953289670'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/war-was-wrong.html' title='The war was wrong'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116901592007203838</id><published>2007-01-17T01:36:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-17T01:38:40.086-05:00</updated><title type='text'>No more actors</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/262293/brokebackmounatin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/523198/brokebackmounatin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/17/technology/17porn.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt; Is Live Sex On-Demand Coming to Hotel TVs?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 17, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;LAS VEGAS, Jan. 16 — In the world of on-demand viewing of sexually explicit material, the next step could be the ability to watch live performers from the privacy of a hotel room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was one topic during a panel discussion here at Internext, an annual trade show for sex entertainment industry producers, marketers and payment processors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gregory Clayman, the owner of the live-action company Video Secrets, predicted that the industry would soon be selling not just videos on demand in mainstream hotels, but images of people having sex live over the hotels’ entertainment systems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We feel that live, right now, is coming of age,” Mr. Clayman said. “We are planning to make the jump to hotel rooms.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said that as television sets and computers merge into the same appliance, he saw no reason that live action sex would not get a place in on-demand services in hotels. Some existing Web sites already allow customers to send text messages to direct the performers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Americans spent $1.6 billion last year for on-demand and pay-per-view video, according to JupiterKagan, a media research firm. It estimates that about a third of those sales were for sex films.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anne Taulane, managing editor of Lodging magazine, who has written about the ways hotel chains require sex films to be edited and about groups that oppose any such films, expressed doubt that the major hotel chains would ever go along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That would be a hard sell to the big hotel companies,” she said in a telephone interview. “The porn offered now is a little more acceptable to the mainstream” than viewing live action over a hotel’s video entertainment system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Panelists also praised Visa and MasterCard for new programs that have helped reduce disputes and refusals to pay for pornography ordered over the Internet by credit card.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116901592007203838/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116901592007203838&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116901592007203838'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116901592007203838'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/no-more-actors.html' title='No more actors'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116901565541427287</id><published>2007-01-17T01:26:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-17T01:34:15.743-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Good luck, Jane</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

It coincided with a report from the United Nations that said 34,452 Iraqi civilians died violently last year -- an average of 94 per day -- an estimate nearly triple the death toll provided by three Iraqi government ministries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gianni Magazzeni, chief of the U.N. Assistance Mission for Iraq, said the killings were driven by strife between Sunni and Shiite militants. &quot;Without significant progress in the rule of law, sectarian violence will continue indefinitely and eventually spiral out of control,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;News agencies reported that at least 30 other people died violently in Iraq on Tuesday, bringing the day&#39;s total to about 100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Mustansiriya University, sophomore Dyana Ayad had finished her Arabic elocution test, then walked through the college gardens, turned right toward a pedestrian overpass and joined the crowd of students waiting for buses. The pressure filled her ears a split second before she heard the sound of a bomb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I saw unbelievable things,&quot; the 20-year-old recalled Tuesday night. &quot;There were tiny pieces of papers, burned papers everywhere. And dark smoke, white smoke. . . . I saw arms, legs, body parts flying in the air. The sky was raining burning paper and body parts.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Firefighters and police sped to the scene of the wreckage, near Palestine Street in eastern Baghdad, doused the flaming cars and buses, and ferried bloodied students to hospitals throughout the city. Students ran in panic to find their friends, witnesses said, picking through what one student called &quot;pieces of meat.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The university&#39;s assistant president, Fadhil al-Amri, found a human head on the ground outside his office, next to a severed hand.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116901121981763440/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116901121981763440&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116901121981763440'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116901121981763440'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/more-dead-in-iraq.html' title='More dead in Iraq'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116899540950909920</id><published>2007-01-16T19:23:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-16T19:56:50.440-05:00</updated><title type='text'>I don&#39;t know</title><content type='html'>&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-title&quot;&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;post-title&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://operationyellowelephant.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;   Walter Reed Welcomes [?] College Republicans, Friday Evening, January 19, 2007&lt;/a&gt;     &lt;/h3&gt;                               &lt;p&gt;       &lt;/p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/5388/85/1600/976428/OPYE.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;margin: 0px auto 10px; display: block; text-align: center;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/5388/85/400/298139/OPYE.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;The George Washington University (GWU) College Republicans have scheduled a visit to the Wounded Warriors at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., this coming Friday evening, January 19. &lt;a href=&quot;http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2007/01/16/Opinions/Gary-Livacari.Peter.Glessing.The.Children.Of.The.60s-2633289.shtml?sourcedomain=www.gwhatchet.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com&quot;&gt;Money quotes&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;- - - - - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;em&gt;But the political cynicism prevalent on GW&#39;s campus and across our nation tells a different and more disturbing story. Like our parents in Vietnam, &lt;strong&gt;we have lost the will to fight, to make the sacrifices that are necessary to protect our country.&lt;/strong&gt; We have substituted healthy patriotism and deep reverence for American traditions with petty protests and condemnations of our nation&#39;s highest leaders.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;- - - - - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Our generation has been courageous in combat, but &lt;strong&gt;the home front has yet to wholeheartedly endorse America&#39;s historic mission to transform the Middle East.&lt;/strong&gt; Generation Y, which includes the GW student community, has denied the troops the steadfast support required for victory. &lt;strong&gt;Unless we vigorously defend the mission in Iraq, our country will again suffer a devastating defeat and its reputation will be irreparably damaged. We can&#39;t let this happen.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;With President Bush&#39;s recent proposal to commit more than 20,000 new American troops to Baghdad, &lt;strong&gt;our generation has an opportunity to renew its devotion to winning the war on terror and earn its billing as the new greatest generation. The GW College Republicans will do its part to answer this critical calling.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;We invite all students, regardless of party affiliation, to join us in visiting wounded American soldiers at Walter Reed Hospital this Friday night. While war is an understandable source of disagreement, we must transcend partisan divisions and facilitate broad-based support for the men and women of the armed forces. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;- - - - - -&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All visitors to Walter Reed are welcome (most especially young women). This includes veterans, ROTC/OCS/etc., and anyone not personally eligible to serve. Your support is greatly appreciated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if the best that the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; male GWU College Republicans -- all healthy heterosexuals eligible to serve -- can do to answer this &quot;critical calling&quot; is visit our Wounded Warriors in the hospital, they might as well just stay home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Otherwise, they should be prepared for a real Wounded Warrior (already more of a man than any of them will ever be) to candidly and frankly urge the GWU College Republicans to Be A Man! Enlist! right there. Chickenhawk pussy excuses won&#39;t cut it, so why don&#39;t you do everyone a favor and let the female GWU College Republicans go by themselves? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think some of these dumb fucks need to go to Walter Reed and see their peers surviving Bush&#39;s war. But I think if they treat it like a freak show, or start in with Bushie bullshit, some of them are going to find how much a prostethic leg hurts when it kicks you in the ass.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My hope is that they realize that their words are bullshit and the men and women they want to visit deserve dignity and respect.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116899540950909920/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116899540950909920&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116899540950909920'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116899540950909920'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-dont-know.html' title='I don&#39;t know'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116896248885471909</id><published>2007-01-16T10:09:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-16T10:48:09.683-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Dear Max</title><content type='html'>Max,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man often has to be stripped of his delusions, especially when creating heroes. But  unless I&#39;m confused, both the Weathermen and Panthers had their roots in SDS and SNCC. And I would say when you get into the bomb and gun business, you&#39;ve slipped into terrorism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, Max, some of the netroots &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;started out &lt;/span&gt;as campaign consultants and others HAVE morphed into them. Which sort of undercuts your point, but that&#39;s OK. They&#39;ve chosen to do that. Not my choice, but it&#39;s there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hate to tell you, but American politics has always been shallow. Mistresses, bastard kids, religion have always had a role, just like Obama&#39;s name and Kerry&#39;s personality. Thomas Jefferson was dogged with rumors of his having a black mistress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You seem to have this fantasy that political power comes from some combination of good intentions and honesty The fact is that the left, from the Greens down to Avakian&#39;s bunch, have either debated everything to death or created a cult of personality. I don&#39;t think you know what political power is. I mean, you have an idea of what it is, but you don&#39;t really get how it works, because it&#39;s all theory to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s say you want a parking spot outside your store. A mundane thing, but people need them. How do you get it?  You can apply for one, or you can call the mayor, who you supported and ask him for help.  That&#39;s power in action, getting things done. If you haven&#39;t noticed, Labor&#39;s power to affect it&#39;s own fate has been limited over the years, and decades of GOP rule has limited their power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, and did you forget that labor during George Meany was right tilting, supporting the war and Nixon?  That started the trend towards limiting labor&#39;s power, a self-inflicted wound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max, I&#39;m 42 years old. I know talking about Marx not only bores the shit out of people, it marks you as a less than serious person. It isn&#39;t anti-intellectualism, but a simple fact that the Beatles recognized nearly 40 years ago.  You don&#39;t win people over by discussing theory, but by delivering for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And what you describe as &quot;leaderless groups&quot; aren&#39;t leaderless. They just don&#39;t need a Nader to tell them to do what they need to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think people on the left fear leadership from below. They talk a good game of it, but they don&#39;t want some housewife telling them what to do. They recoil when they meet the Cindy Sheehans of the world, they sneer at the Michael Moores.  They try to hide their elitism and classist views with talk of solidarity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max, this isn&#39;t a big institution, it&#39;s people&#39;s lives. When your pet theories fail, people pay for it.  The netroots, and that&#39;s actually an idea I find slightly overblown, is not about a movement, but people trying to better their own lives without waiting for permission to do so.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116896248885471909/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116896248885471909&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116896248885471909'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116896248885471909'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/dear-max.html' title='Dear Max'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116896003843390324</id><published>2007-01-16T10:04:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-16T10:07:18.476-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Max responds</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://maxspeak.org/mt/archives/002781.html&quot;&gt; A NOTE FOR STEVE GILLIARD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;[Steve G. is a prominent Kos alumni blogger. He did the infamous blackface photoshop of Michael Steele, which I thought was totally fine and dandy. I don&#39;t follow his site because he evidently does not follow mine -- nobody&#39;s perfect -- so my remarks about netroots could not have been directed particularly at him. Below is a response to his response to my response to Matt Stoller&#39;s response to the 60s left. -- mbs]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People say I&#39;m arrogant, but what do they know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve, you&#39;re a fine blogger and all-around human being, but there is so much you don&#39;t know about the pre-Internet left. Your descriptions of SDS and SNCC are ridiculous. They &quot;morphed into terrorists&quot;? Really, do some research. I could as easily say the netroots&#39; leaders have morphed into campaign consultants. That would be almost but not quite as foolish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;re right that I run the same hazards of generalization as someone discussing the 60s, or any other time. It&#39;s easy to cherry-pick exceptions. No doubt the (old) New Left made tons of mistakes, including the sin or arrogance (isn&#39;t that what people in Iowa said about Deaniacs in the 2004 caucuses . . . ?).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know all about the whiteness, class biases, and lack of internal democracy in activist groups. Truth is, you don&#39;t find much democracy in any big institution. Mainly this is distraction from the underlying political issues, a distraction that the commercial media and right opposition is fond of fomenting. Like talking about Obama&#39;s middle name or his lack of a necktie, instead of his substantive concerns. Even so, the middle class drift in the 70s accomplished a lot in the areas of environmentalism and feminism, among others.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You don&#39;t really address my criticism of the netroots. I acknowledge that it has been great at raising money and helping Democrats. And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that, but that&#39;s a limitation as well as a virtue, particularly from a left perspective. THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS GAINING POLITICAL POWER. Labor provides tons of resources to Democrats, has for years, and its power over policy is nowhere near proportional to its support. You also betray the weakness I note of anti-intellectualism: you think talk of Marx bores people and isn&#39;t conducive to organizing meet-ups.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, you have drunk the Kos kool-aid about &#39;empowerment&#39; and leaderless groups. Don&#39;t you realize this is a reprise of the delusions of the early SDS and &quot;participatory democracy&quot;? The only thing missing is the keyboards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Internet is a great tool for empowerment, but people have yet to be empowered. &lt;br /&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;posted&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116896003843390324/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116896003843390324&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116896003843390324'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116896003843390324'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/max-responds.html' title='Max responds'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116893580356894129</id><published>2007-01-16T03:23:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-16T03:23:23.586-05:00</updated><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Martin Luther King, &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot;

are false, except for this one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Matt Stoller is well-situated to talk about the intersection of contemporary internet-based protest and the Democratic Party. He does not seem very current on the boots-on-the-ground left that is responsible for the huge anti-war demonstrations we have seen since 2002, as well as for local organizing against Wal-Mart and for the &quot;living wage.&quot; About the 60s left, he is all wet. Why does this matter? It speaks to the limits of the netroots when it comes to policy, program, ideology, and intellectual world-view.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;Internet Left&quot; is a mostly brainless vacuum cleaner of donations for the Democratic Party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s go chronologically. Two preeminent organs of the 1960s left were the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). SNCC had at least two distinct vintages which I would characterize as before and after Stokely. Before was integrationist, social-democratic, and reformist. After was black nationalist and radical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;SDS was never a centralized organization with a unified ideology. The politics of its presidents (and later a collective leadership) changed significantly over the years. At the beginning there were social-democratic and laborist roots. Soon there was a decentralist community organizing focus, alienated from the Democratic Party. Later still there was serious, non-dogmatic interest in Marx (my favorite period, typified by people like Carl Oglesby and Carl Davidson). Later still we had the deranged &quot;Weather-people,&quot; multiple Maoist and Trotskyist formations, the Stalinist Enver Hoxha-lovin&#39; Progressive Labor Party, etc. etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How in the world could you generalize about this Tower of Babel? Matt tries to, invoking the term &quot;post-scarcity,&quot; which applies to hardly any of the worthies above. He suggests that economics was ignored. This is rubbish. Even those most alienated from the U.S. working class did not hold the starving Third World masses to be under the yoke of a post-scarcity economy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think of how today&#39;s media characterizes &quot;angry bloggers&quot; and the netroots, and consider whether TIME Magazine-type descriptions of SDS or SNCC would have been accurate. In TIME Magazine, then and now, you do not read about class politics. You learn about Stokely Carmichael and Al Sharpton, not about Bill Fletcher or Adolph Reed. You hear about protectionism from the Buchanan right, never from the global justice left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In TIME Magazineland, the latter 90s and &quot;welfare reform&quot; were triumphs of Clintonomics, not the targets of withering critiques.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The contemporary &quot;Internet left&quot; is not very left. It is vociferous, partisan, and alert to opportunities to nail Republicans and Joe Lieberman. And there&#39;s nothing wrong with that. But left? Please.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;* The netroots criticized the Iraqi effort a) for not gaining the support of the U.N.; b) for not armoring the troops sufficiently; c) for not proving the existence of WMDs; d) for not proving connections to Al Queda; e) for not using enough troops. Can we presume that if George H.W. Bush had been there to get the support of the U.N. and prove Saddam had WMDs, an invasion would have been justified?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s start with the last first. I remember Kos and I calling the Iraq war a failed colonial adventure in 2002, before it was started. I predicted that someone like Sadr would rise to power and the exiles would be rejected. But I guess generalizations are fine when one is engaged in a romantic retelling of the 1960&#39;s. But with Google, you will see I predicted the failure of Iraq from before the invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it&#39;s easy to pick on Matt, because this is all history to him, but I&#39;m a little older and I find your comments bordering on Kagan-like misrepresentation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;Internet Left&quot; has done more in three years than any of the groups you hail as heroes from the 1960&#39;s did in 10 years. Why? Because neither SDS or SNCC were actually interested in democratic politics. They morphed into terrorists. Now, it&#39;s all nice to recall the Panthers and their cute black leather jackets, but in the end, they were bait for the FBI because they preached guns and violence. Neither SDS or SNCC lived more than a few years because they had no interest in working with people, only &quot;the people&quot;. Their community organizing skills rarely coopted the people who could make them last. They centered on a dynamic leader, not the community.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New Left failed because it was arrogant. It didn&#39;t listen and didn&#39;t care about the people they were supposed to work with. They wanted to lead without listening.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You should remind people how the Panthers devolved into drug-dealing gangsters. It was macho theatrics, not real leadership. The SDS, which morphed into the Weathermen, are remembered for their incompetence in bomb making.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, if you think being on the left is about Marx and discussions, you have to be kidding. Who was going to listen to that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people who suceeded were the ones who left the &quot;movement&quot; and ran for office, or who grew up, like Joseph Lowery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then we had the autocratic Nader movement, with one leader, and many followers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Max, I also find it amusing that you forget to note how the class differences on the left would be enshrined. You keep talking about the &quot;left&quot;, but let me let you in on a secret, that left was exclusionary as hell. Public Citizen had rich, white interns who could afford to be paid those miserable salaries, excluding many who could have expanded the movement. From NARAL to the Sierra Club, they all became havens for the rich. I applied for a job at the Audibon Society and got a plea for donations with my rejection letter. Who does that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You laud these groups, but forget what they did. They shifted the discussion on the left from civil rights to toasters. They embraced the consumer economy and sought to perfect it, while the working class was slowly being screwed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then you talk about the anti-war protests. You mean the embarassing ones run by ANSWER, which alienated more people than gained their support.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meetings? You mean like the Greens had? They were good at talking and bad at doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think what you resent about the &quot;Internet Left&quot; is that they get things done.  The Greens can&#39;t get past the city council level. Chris Bowers got millions of dollars to win races. Which might actually change people&#39;s lives and not end up in a circle jerk discussion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I think you are blind to is that you admired the organized, New Left, where people had rules and read books and marched. Instead of the &quot;Internet left&quot; which actually empowers people to participate in politics. You would think that someone on the left would be excited by that, and you would want to encourage it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The New Left failed. It was only when people embraced political power did changes really happen. The &quot;Internet left&quot; empowers people to act on their own or with others, with no &quot;leader&quot; to direct them. One would think that real people power, not just the crap tossed about in meetings, would be exciting.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116892447840996165/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116892447840996165&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116892447840996165'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116892447840996165'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/good-old-days-my-ass.html' title='The good old days my ass'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116892879946910485</id><published>2007-01-16T01:24:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-16T01:26:39.496-05:00</updated><title type='text'>A simple question</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/20134/f16.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/854689/f16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens if the Iraqi Shia take an attack on Iran as an attack on them?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116892879946910485/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116892879946910485&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116892879946910485'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116892879946910485'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/simple-question.html' title='A simple question'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116892635489930088</id><published>2007-01-16T00:41:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-16T00:45:54.940-05:00</updated><title type='text'>What bubble?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/16/business/16rentals.xlarge1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/16/business/16rentals.xlarge1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;font-size:78%;&quot; &gt;Michael Temchine for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Columbia, above, formerly the Columbia&lt;br /&gt;Hospital for Women, is a new complex of condos&lt;br /&gt;in the Foggy Bottom section of Washington. An&lt;br /&gt;owner who bought a two-bedroom unit in 2004&lt;br /&gt;is facing having to sell it at a loss or rent it for less&lt;br /&gt;than his monthly payment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/16/realestate/16rentals.html?hp&amp;ex=1169010000&amp;amp;amp;en=2afc72067a1f2634&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt;Buyers Scarce, Many Condos Are for Rent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By VIKAS BAJAJ&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 16, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON — David Franco’s illuminated model of a proposed 10-story condominium tower dominates a sales center that, in spite of the “Now Selling” banner still fluttering outside, is conspicuously closed for business.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We could have waited it out and kept pushing and pushing,” Mr. Franco said about the decision to abandon plans to sell 180 luxury condominiums with floor-to-ceiling windows offering views of the Washington Monument and Capitol Hill. “But it would have taken significantly longer.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After six weeks of failing to lure more than a couple of dozen buyers, Mr. Franco and his partner, Jeff Blum, joined the builders of nearly 6,000 condominium units in the Washington metropolitan area who have decided in the last three months to recast their projects as rental apartment buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since the middle of 2006, the frenzied condominium market here and in several other big cities like Las Vegas, Miami and Boston has collapsed. Once roaring sales have slowed to a trickle, sparse inventory has mushroomed into a glut and soaring prices have flattened out and started falling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many cities, banks have significantly scaled back loans to condominium builders. Some have demanded that developers sell half or more of the units in a building before even beginning construction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In hopes of salvaging something from their costly plans, hundreds of developers like Mr. Franco are looking to the strong market for apartments, planning to rent their units for at least a couple of years while waiting for today’s condo surplus to shrink. Mr. Franco and Mr. Blum hope to break ground on what will be a somewhat less expensive building this spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some cases, developers are even turning older buildings back to rentals after a brief or aborted attempt at condo conversion. Meanwhile, another 2,500 proposed condominiums in the Washington area have been scrapped altogether, according to Delta Associates, a real estate research firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest salvage operation on the part of condo developers is far from a sure bet, however. Condominium buildings generally cost more to build and operate than those built for apartments from scratch. And while rents are high and rising in most cities, in many cases they still are not sufficient to turn a profit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116892635489930088/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116892635489930088&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116892635489930088'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116892635489930088'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-bubble.html' title='What bubble?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116891704671937914</id><published>2007-01-16T00:07:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-15T22:10:46.780-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Idiocy in action</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/15/us/15pizza2.600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/15/us/15pizza2.600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Allison V.

KOVACH&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 15, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DALLAS, Jan. 14 — Jose Ramirez and two friends stopped by a Pizza Patrón here after work on Thursday for a carry-out dinner. Mr. Ramirez, his jeans dusted with white chalk from the construction site, ordered a Hawaiian and La Patrona — a large with the works.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chain, which has 59 stores in five states, is trying to attract Latinos by using Spanish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chain is accepting pesos in a promotion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The pies cost him almost 220 big ones. Pesos, that is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Ramirez, 20, received his change in American coins and said he liked the chain’s new “Pizza por Pesos” promotion. He had been in the United States for 15 days — his home is in Guanajuato, Mexico — and he wanted to spend the last of his Mexican currency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I just arrived,” he said in Spanish, smiling nervously. “It’s my first time here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The employees at this Pizza Patrón in East Dallas, one of 59 in five Southwestern and Western states, were still puzzling over the conversion rates almost a week after the chain started accepting peso bills on Jan. 8.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the promotion has already hit a nerve in the nationwide immigration debate. The company’s Dallas headquarters received about 1,000 e-mail messages on Thursday alone. Some were supportive, but many called the idea unpatriotic, with messages like, “If you want to accept the peso, go to Mexico!” There were even a few death threats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Antonio Swad, president and founder of Pizza Patrón, said he was surprised by the outcry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I certainly wasn’t expecting ‘pizza for pesos’ to become a touchstone for the immigration issue,” Mr. Swad said. It was nothing more than an effort to “reinforce our brand promise to be the premier Latino pizza chain,” he said. “We’re businessmen.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The Latino population is significant and it’s important,” Mr. Swad continued. “It’s here to stay. The United States is not going to be like it used to be; it’s going to be different, and it has an opportunity to be better.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Swad, who is Italian-Lebanese and was born and raised in Columbus, Ohio, did not speak Spanish when he opened his first take-out pizzeria in Dallas in 1986. But he saw a business opportunity in the growing Latino minority in his neighborhood, and the way his customers struggled to order in English.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A year later he changed the name from Pizza Pizza to Pizza Patrón, hired bilingual staff members and added items like La Mexicana, a pizza that includes spicy chorizo sausage and jalapeños.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pizza Patrón became a franchise in 2003, and same-store sales were up more than 34 percent in the most recent quarter compared with last year, Mr. Swad said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 10 to 15 percent of business at his five Dallas pizzerias has been in pesos, he said. Despite the criticism, he said he would continue the promotion until the end of February as planned.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Canadian businesses take US dollars for payment. So what is the big deal?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116891704671937914/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116891704671937914&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116891704671937914'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116891704671937914'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/idiocy-in-action.html' title='Idiocy in action'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116889075042147310</id><published>2007-01-15T14:39:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-15T14:52:30.636-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Leave Iran Alone</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070115/2007_01_15t003839_327x450_us_iran_nicaragua.jpg?x=250&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=_qG72mjR2Iaiquz4Ny2wsw--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070115/2007_01_15t003839_327x450_us_iran_nicaragua.jpg?x=250&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=_qG72mjR2Iaiquz4Ny2wsw--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He hates Jews, but likes kids&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.progressive.org/node/4253&quot;&gt;“Leave Us Alone,” Iranian Reformers Say&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Muhammad Sahimi&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;December 2006 Issue&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Back in March, the Bush Administration released its new “National Security Strategy of the United States,” and regime change in Iran leaps out of it as a goal. “We may face no greater challenge from a single country than from Iran,” the document baldly states in a grand exaggeration. And for all the recent talk about Iran’s nuclear threat, the document does not confine its discussion of Iran to the nuclear issue. “The United States has broader concerns,” it says. “The Iranian regime sponsors terrorism, threatens Israel, seeks to thwart Middle East peace, disrupts democracy in Iraq, and denies the aspirations of its people for freedom.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All of these issues, along with the nuclear one, “can ultimately be resolved only if the Iranian regime makes the strategic decision to change these policies, open up its political system, and afford freedom to its people,” the document states. “This is the ultimate goal of U.S. policy.” President Bush and Condoleezza Rice may stress in public that they are giving diplomacy a try, but this document makes clear that they have something else in mind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the Bush Administration attacks Iran, it would be violating the U.N. Charter. And it would also be violating the Algiers Accord that the United States signed with Iran in 1981 to end the hostage crisis. Point I, paragraph 1, of that accord states, “The United States pledges that it is and from now on will be the policy of the United States not to intervene, directly or indirectly, politically or militarily, in Iran’s internal affairs.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not only is the goal of regime change illegal, it is also unachievable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Democracy cannot be imported, nor can it be given to a people by invading their nation, nor by bombing them with cluster bombs. It must be indigenous,” says Shirin Ebadi, the Iranian human rights advocate who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2003.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Administration has refused to rule out the possibility of military strikes, and even the use of nuclear weapons, on Iran’s nuclear facilities and beyond, as if the Iraq quagmire has not taught it anything. And Iran is not Iraq. Iraq was formed only in 1932 with artificial boundaries that have no historical roots. Iran, on the other hand, has existed for thousands of years as an independent nation. Hence, Iranian nationalism is extremely fierce. Military strikes on Iran would create a potent mixture that combines fierce Iranian nationalism with the Shiites’ long tradition of martyrdom in defense of their homeland and religion. The attacks would engulf the entire region in flames.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Iranians will not allow a single U.S. soldier to set foot in Iran,” declares Ebadi, and this is a woman who has been imprisoned by Iran’s hardliners and is constantly harassed for her work on behalf of political prisoners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armchair warriors, such as William Kristol, have been claiming that intense bombing of Iran will lead to an uprising by Iranians. The absurd argument is that, “We will destroy Iran, but Iranians will love us for bombing them, and hate the hardliners.” Although a large majority of Iranians despise the hardliners, anyone who has the slightest familiarity with Iran’s history knows that intense bombing of Iran will not lead to their downfall. Rather, it will help them consolidate power.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116889075042147310/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116889075042147310&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116889075042147310'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116889075042147310'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/leave-iran-alone.html' title='Leave Iran Alone'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116882688914971978</id><published>2007-01-15T12:30:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-15T12:17:40.826-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Fixing things</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.firstnationalbank.com/images/jWin%20DVD%20Player.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;WIDTH: 320px; CURSOR: pointer&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.firstnationalbank.com/images/jWin%20DVD%20Player.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://shopping.guardian.co.uk/electrical/story/0,,1990656,00.html&quot;&gt;On the mend&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;When getting a broken appliance fixed is often more expensive than replacing it, it&#39;s not surprising that repair is a dying art. Tim Dowling tries to buck the trend by fixing things himself, and three other Guardian writers try to find someone - anyone - to put their gadgets together again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday January 15, 2007&lt;br /&gt;The Guardian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The disposable culture started small. In 1892 William Painter, founder of the Baltimore Bottle Seal Company, patented the crown cork, which would soon become more widely known as the bottle cap. The bottles were returned and refilled, but the bottle caps got thrown away. They only worked once. Painter&#39;s chief salesman at the time was King Camp Gillette, who went on to apply the principle to his own invention, the disposable razor blade. Today almost everything has its disposable version - cameras, nappies, barbecues - but the concept has been taken a step further. Economic imperatives have made most of our consumer durables effectively disposable. In short, they are often cheaper to replace than they are to mend. This applies not just to radios and toasters, but to fridges, televisions and dishwashers. We now live in a disposable culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We no longer revel in it, however. We know we should be reducing the amount of waste we produce, although for all our efforts to compost or recycle, landfill continues to increase. It&#39;s hard to slip a CD player into the bottom of the rubbish these days without feeling a pang of conscience, especially if you suspect that all it needs is a bit of mending. But who fixes that sort of thing any more? And how much would they charge you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As if we weren&#39;t throwing enough away already, modern life has given us dozens of bewildering new appliances - set-top boxes, modem-routers - whose very purpose is almost as mysterious as their workings. To the untrained eye, they appear to be nothing more than plastic boxes that get a bit hot when you plug them in. Every new gadget seems to come with its own remote control or charging station, without which it is inoperable, and which is destined to go missing. In some cases the stuff is literally irreparable; either the spare parts are not supplied or there is nothing to fix - the appliance itself is considered a &quot;complete replacement unit&quot;. What do you do, for example, with a broken electric toothbrush? If you&#39;re like me, you go out and buy a new one, and then another new one, and then another, until eventually you learn that electric toothbrushes are a sort of con: you&#39;re lucky if the base outlives two replacement heads.&lt;br /&gt;..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mimi Spencer, Hove&lt;br /&gt;The DVD player&lt;br /&gt;My chunky Toshiba DVD player, bought in 2003, threw in the towel a few weeks back. Needless to say, I didn&#39;t have extended warranty cover for my dead appliance. But, still, I took it back to my local branch of Currys to see what could be done. As I carried it in from the car, nursing the plug, lead and remote control unit to my chest, I felt oddly fond of it. We&#39;d had good nights together, that DVD and I.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Currys boy happened to be immensely tall, with large hands and eyes like a switched-off telly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Would it be possible ... ?&quot; I started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Can&#39;t fix it. Not worth it,&quot; he uttered, twiddling something fascinating in his trouser pocket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;But it&#39;s only three years old,&quot; I said, as if pleading for the life of a sick puppy. &quot;Surely there must be something ... &quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Customer services,&quot; he said, sending me off with a shove of his head.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Adrian at customer services was a bored man, but he did have a gadget on his computer which allowed him to pull up my entire electronic history with the company. The DVD player was uncovered and thus unmendable and wholly uninteresting to Adrian. &quot;It&#39;s not on the screen,&quot; he sniffed. &quot;There&#39;s nothing I can do.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Have you tried a lens cleaner?&quot; he inquired, rather benevolently, I thought. Yes, I had tried a lens cleaner. &quot;Well,&quot; he said, in a conspiratorially low whisper, as if being overheard might be a sackable offence, &quot;you could try the, erm, shop on Sackville Road. Might do it. Depends what&#39;s wrong with it. But&quot; - his voice rose perceptibly - &quot;you&#39;d be better off getting a new one. They cost less than 30 quid.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was tempting. There was something provocative about the slimline DVD players lined up like dancing girls on the shelf. One model cost just £19.99, about the same price as a DVD of The Constant Gardener; this seemed all wrong, like paying more for the coffee than the cup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Um, Adrian,&quot; I asked gingerly, &quot;could you recycle it if I can&#39;t fix it?&quot; The answer was an inevitable no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Smith Video Repair Centre, dumped on the corner of a residential street in Hove, is one of those places, like Mr Benn&#39;s shop, that might not be there next time you look. Inside, the rectangular video recorders and cuboid cathode-ray TVs are stacked in neat ranks, each with a label indicating its medical history. &quot;Dead,&quot; said some. Others said, &quot;Done.&quot; It was like a geriatric ward for entertainment systems, but there was hope in this room. Here, tinkering with a screwdriver clearly yielded results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A man with a moustache emerged from a back room and accepted my DVD player, bidding me to await his call with the prognosis. How much would it cost? That would depend, he said, leaving the mystery hanging in the mote-filled air. I left hoping for the best, willing that the fix would cost less than £19.99.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Smith called. The laser was faulty. He had rung a couple of wholesalers, but they didn&#39;t have one in stock. &quot;Lasers,&quot; admitted Robert, &quot;can be pretty expensive.&quot; How expensive exactly? More than £19.99? My heart wanted him to say no, but my brain already knew the DVD was a DNR. &quot;Anything from £20 to £100,&quot; replied Robert, like a surgeon breaking the news gently. &quot;You may want to think about writing it off,&quot; he continued, getting as close to holding my hand as you can over the phone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was nothing for it. The old Toshiba is, alas, off to Guangdong, to be strip-searched for a morsel of metal and dumped in a lake. The slinky new silver DVD player sits under the TV and looks adorable, like a kitten. It&#39;s working beautifully. I give it a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6600cc;&quot;&gt;Jen here.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6600cc;&quot;&gt;Yes to everything folks have said so far in the comments. It is disgusting how little one can do to preserve any investment in anything for want of a simple fix. FWIW, I had a $5 part--the wave diffuser--go on a very good mircowave that I have. I was able to slide the old one out with a screwdriver--and put a new one in with said implement. The whole operation took $12 and 5 minutes. Where did I get the part? Take note of this:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://circuitcity.partsearch.com/&quot;&gt;Circuit City Part Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6600cc;&quot;&gt;When I first posted up the microwave story, lots of people said I was being cheap for not just getting a new one. WTF? $12 part for a microwave that works great, versus a cheap piece of new shit for $100? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6600cc;&quot;&gt;You know what I went and got from the hardware store yesterday? New rubber rings for my Osterizer blender. My ugly almond-color Osterizer blender. Not the avocado one that my Mom got as an engagement gift in 1963, which she still has, but the one that she got as a housewarming gift for the one year that we lived in NJ in 1971. Its motor is stronger than anything commercially available today and it really, really works. Mom replaced the blades (a $15 part) once around 15 years ago before she gave it to me to take to DC when I was in law school. This is what it looks like, sort of (mine&#39;s older):&lt;img style=&quot;DISPLAY: block; MARGIN: 0px auto 10px; CURSOR: hand; TEXT-ALIGN: center&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/5102/28/200/446063/blender.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6600cc;&quot;&gt;True story: A few years ago a couple I know had a chili potluck party. One of their wedding gifts was a Cuisinart blender--a few years old. They tried to crush ice in it for margaritas and the motor burned out. Luckilly, they had a secondhand Osterizer from her Mom in the storage area. They washed it off, fired it up, and soon it was margaritas for all. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6600cc;&quot;&gt;When I went to get the replacement rings, the guy asked me how long I&#39;d had my machine. When I told him, he a) initially asked if I was going to sell it and then b) told me to never sell it. Apparently, those in the know scour yard sales for these. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#6600cc;&quot;&gt;I&#39;ve also fixed my old VCR once (I keep it around for my legacy 80&#39;s music videos that I taped off of Night Flight and MTV before it started to suck) as well as other old TV shows. When it goes, I may loose access to them unless I get them converted to DVD. Shame, really.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116882688914971978/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116882688914971978&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882688914971978'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882688914971978'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/fixing-things.html' title='Fixing things'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116887962147319641</id><published>2007-01-15T11:44:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-15T11:47:01.526-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Give me back my airmen</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/682319/pj.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/793067/pj.jpg&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.avweb.com/eletter/archives/avflash/783-full.html#194210&quot;&gt;Airmen as &#39;light infantry&#39; may hinder AF mission&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Commentary by Lt. Col. Gerald Goodfellow&lt;br /&gt;28th Operations Group&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;1/10/2007 - ELLSWORTH AIR FORCE BASE, S.D. (ACCNS) -- Every couple of weeks I have the pleasure of briefing Ellsworth Air Force Base&#39;s newest first-term Airmen. Every time I brief these young Airmen, I make the point that the majority of our day-to-day focus here in the 28th Bomb Wing is to put &quot;Bombs on Target from B-1 Bombers.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, since Sept. 11 many Ellsworth Airmen have participated in combat operations that do not have anything to do with putting bombs on target from B-1s. In fact, Airmen from across Ellsworth have filled ground force combat gaps and taken part in harrowing firefights and missions in support of ground (mostly Army) forces through &quot;in-lieu-of&quot; taskings. I deeply respect the Airmen from Ellsworth who are, in many cases, heroically supporting our current wars on the ground. It is a fortunate situation that Air Force Airmen can support the joint fight and add to America&#39;s security in ways we did not imagine in the past. It is also fortunate for the other services&#39; ground forces that we can &quot;prop up&quot; their capabilities by supporting them through these &quot;in-lieu-of&quot; taskings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These kinds of taskings are not what most of us expected when we joined the Air Force. However, these are taskings that we are now being given and it is reassuring to me that we, as professional Airmen, will continue to carry them out with the same professionalism and dedication we aspire to when we &quot;put bombs on target&quot; from B-1s. This dedication and professionalism is what makes me feel fortunate to be part of the Ellsworth team and a Service, the U.S. Air Force, which has so selflessly supported these taskings. However, at some point the military community as a whole will need to take a hard look at the &quot;in-lieu-of&quot; taskings concept, and determine if Airmen should continue to perform these kinds of taskings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I personally hope that all the services are currently striving to organize in a way that will largely prevent Air Force personnel from conducting &quot;in-lieu-of&quot; taskings in the future. This is because I do not believe the Air Force should be in the business of fighting combat operations on the ground. For example, although today it is a necessity, I do not believe in the long-run any Army or Air Force general officer will determine that it is in America&#39;s best security interests to continue to have Airmen driving trucks in Army convoys. As Air Force Doctrine Document 1 points out, the role of the Air Force spelled out by law in the National Security Act of 1947 is to &quot;Organize, train, and equip aviation forces for prompt and sustained offensive and defensive air operations. This basic charter has essentially remained unchanged to the present.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America has branches of the service that specialize in ground combat and those services should perform those roles as directed by law just as the Air Force should perform its roles as directed by law. Ground warfare is not a role of the Air Force beyond some very specialized duties all of which are spelled out in Air Force doctrine, which include: force protection of air assets on the ground where they are most vulnerable, special operations to enhance air warfare, civil engineering functions (to include combat engineers), etc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last sentence of the current Air Force mission statement boils down very succinctly what I hope we continue to concentrate on in the Air Force: &quot;...to fly and fight in Air, Space, and Cyberspace.&quot; I believe our piece of that mission here at Ellsworth is flying and fighting from B-1s, and meeting our additional Air Force responsibilities to man expeditionary Air Force units with expeditionary combat support forces to support the larger overall Air Force mission. Ideally, I believe everybody stationed at Ellsworth from the wing commander to the Airmen in civil engineering, maintenance, flight kitchen, personnel, bomb squadrons, etc., should be stationed at Ellsworth to support our B-1 and expeditionary combat support mission. I do understand that Airmen at Ellsworth will continue to fill &quot;in-lieu-of&quot; taskings for the foreseeable future. However, I also hope we can support these taskings without diminishing B-1 or Air Force capabilities. In fact, anybody who seriously considers combat for a living realizes the Air Force&#39;s importance to the joint fight, and would never want to see Air Force capabilities diminished. In a nutshell:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Who controls the air controls the fight. When all the sterile debates between Soldiers and Airmen are set aside, this hard reality remains. It has been more than fifty years since U.S. forces faced an enemy willing and able to contest control of the airspace over the battlefield. We can&#39;t count on that condition to endure automatically. Were it to change, the offensive rapidity demonstrated so vividly in this war would become virtually infeasible. The Army and Marine Corps thus have a vested interest in the continued unchallenged superiority of their Air Force, Navy, and Marine Air partners, and acknowledging that interest needn&#39;t and shouldn&#39;t be seen as undermining their own strategic importance.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above statement from the April 24, 2003 Washington Post was written by retired Col. Richard Sinnreich during the first weeks of Operation Iraqi Freedom. What makes the statement so compelling is the fact that Colonel Sinnreich is not an Air Force officer but a former Army officer, who served at the Army&#39;s School for Advanced Military Studies, as its director between 1985 and 1987. SAMS is perhaps the Army&#39;s premier school for training officers with the abilities to solve complex war related problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In America&#39;s current wars the Air Force has found itself in a situation where it, in effect, has to pay for and train its Airmen to serve ground duty (a form of &quot;light infantry&quot;, to quote Gen. Ronald Keys, Air Combat Command commander) and then pay to supply that light infantry with items from bullet proof vests to armored vehicles to keep them safe. In the future I hope the Air Force can stop doing this because I, like Colonel Sinnreich, believe the Air Force and our nation have a vested interest in retaining the ability to gain and maintain air superiority in our future wars. Further, I believe the Air Force should spend its money on capabilities that will ensure future air dominance. When the Air Force loses manpower or defense money because it has to fill unanticipated gaps in sister service capabilities, the Air Force is put at a disadvantage when it comes to modernizing its own capabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find myself in a dilemma when it comes to &quot;in-lieu-of&quot; taskings. I&#39;m so very proud when I hear the stories of the firefights and tough ground combat that Ellsworth Airmen are performing as part of their &quot;in-lieu-of&quot; service. However, I also understand that supporting non-Air Force roles for prolonged periods could in the long run prove detrimental to the Air Force and America&#39;s overall security. This is why it is so important that we at Ellsworth continue to find ways to work smarter to fulfill our &quot;bombs on target&quot; mission while we continue to support the other kinds of taskings we receive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116887962147319641/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116887962147319641&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116887962147319641'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116887962147319641'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/give-me-back-my-airmen.html' title='Give me back my airmen'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116884793378915376</id><published>2007-01-15T03:54:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-15T02:59:50.426-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Yeah, attacking the Mahdi Army will happen</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/494383/muqtada-al-sadr.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/584912/muqtada-al-sadr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Maliki does what I say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/15/world/middleeast/15baghdad.html?ei=5094&amp;en=4666f60671e0a842&amp;amp;amp;amp;hp=&amp;ex=1168837200&amp;amp;partner=homepage&amp;amp;pagewanted=print&quot;&gt;U.S. and Iraqis Are Wrangling Over War Plans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By JOHN F. BURNS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;This article was reported by John F. Burns, Sabrina Tavernise and Marc Santora, and written by Mr. Burns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan. 14 — Just days after President Bush unveiled a new war plan calling for more than 20,000 additional American troops in Iraq, the heart of the effort — a major push to secure the capital — faces some of its fiercest resistance from the very people it depends on for success: Iraqi government officials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American military officials have spent days huddled in meetings with Iraqi officers in a race to turn blueprints drawn up in Washington into a plan that will work on the ground in Baghdad. With the first American and Iraqi units dedicated to the plan due to be in place within weeks, time is short for setting details of what American officers view as the decisive battle of the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the signs so far have unnerved some Americans working on the plan, who have described a web of problems — ranging from a contested chain of command to how to protect American troops deployed in some of Baghdad’s most dangerous districts — that some fear could hobble the effort before it begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First among the American concerns is a Shiite-led government that has been so dogmatic in its attitude that the Americans worry that they will be frustrated in their aim of cracking down equally on Shiite and Sunni extremists, a strategy President Bush has declared central to the plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We are implementing a strategy to embolden a government that is actually part of the problem,” said an American military official in Baghdad involved in talks over the plan. “We are being played like a pawn.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American military’s misgivings came as new details emerged of the reconstruction portion of Mr. Bush’s plan, which calls for more than doubling the number of American-led reconstruction teams in Iraq to 22 and quintupling the number of American civilian reconstruction specialists to 500. [Page A7.]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Compounding American doubts about the government’s willingness to go after Shiite extremists has been a behind-the-scenes struggle over the appointment of the Iraqi officer to fill the key post of operational commander for the Baghdad operation. In face of strong American skepticism, the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, has selected an officer from the Shiite heartland of southern Iraq who was virtually unknown to the Americans, and whose hard-edged demands for Iraqi primacy in the effort has deepened American anxieties.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116884793378915376/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116884793378915376&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116884793378915376'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116884793378915376'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/yeah-attacking-mahdi-army-will-happen.html' title='Yeah, attacking the Mahdi Army will happen'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116883960779986770</id><published>2007-01-15T03:36:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-15T00:41:08.146-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Where is Hillary?</title><content type='html'>Is Hillary Clinton going to oppose the war or not?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing statements no longer count.

Bush had now announced he was deploying more troops of an overextended Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What can I do? ...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He had already written countless letters and made endless calls to politicians and military officials in an effort to get his son home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What can I do? ...&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No answer came. Alexander suffered seemingly minor physical distress during the night, but told his wife he was all right and he rolled over. He never woke again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The autopsy found no evidence of heart trouble or an aneurysm. The best medical guess was his death resulted from a seizure disorder he had periodically experienced.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such seizures can be triggered and intensified by the biochemical changes that accompany stress. Nobody is saying Bush gave Alexander the condition. The possibility remains that a presidential address preceded by months of high anxiety translated into a blast of seizure-inducing norepinephrine, corticosteroids and other chemicals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You cannot help but wonder if perhaps this was the first death by speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It wasn&#39;t Bush,&quot; his sister Diane Mooney charitably allows. &quot;But he didn&#39;t help.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Alexander&#39;s mother voices the stronger view that what ultimately killed her only son was the stress of having his boy serve two tours in Iraq, topped by watching the commander in chief announce he was dispatching more troops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I believe that caused his death,&quot; 82-year-old Mary Alexander said Friday night. &quot;I believe in my heart and soul that&#39;s what put Howard where he is today. He couldn&#39;t take it.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116883634207604356/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116883634207604356&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116883634207604356'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116883634207604356'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/what-can-i-do.html' title='What can I do?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116882913832126379</id><published>2007-01-15T01:37:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-14T21:45:38.356-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The scourge of the Kagans</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/510402/Frederick_Kagan.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/874820/Frederick_Kagan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;This fat fuck is Frederick&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Kagan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/1/14/21715/7058&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diaryTitle&quot;&gt;Frederick Kagan is an Unqualified Fraud: Read His CV Here&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration: underline;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://the-angry-rakkasan.dailykos.com/&quot;&gt;The Angry Rakkasan&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Sun Jan 14, 2007 at 06:29:00 PM PST&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;  &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frederick_Kagan&quot;&gt;Frederick Kagan&lt;/a&gt; is the neo-conservative scholar to whom George W. Bush listens.  Working for the conservative think tank AEI, Kagan supposedly gives the Bush administration intellectual cover—as he is one of the few academic &quot;experts&quot; who supports the President’s ideas.  He can often be found on C-SPAN, sitting on a distinguished-looking panel, articulating his views on the Iraq insurgency.  He is admired by neo-conservatives around the world as being highly knowledgeable in this field, and he is said to have the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2007/01/06/aei/&quot;&gt;ear&lt;/a&gt; of the President.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        So what are Kagan’s credentials if he’s such an expert on the Iraq insurgency?  Well, as it turns out, he’s actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/011921.php&quot;&gt;completely unqualified&lt;/a&gt;, to a point that borders on fraud.  Let’s take a look at his CV....&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- polls come after this --&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;        If you’re still not sure who Frederick Kagan is, he is the author of the following oft cited &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aei.org/scholars/scholarID.99/scholar.asp&quot;&gt;articles&lt;/a&gt; that directly refute the Iraq Study Group Report:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choosing Victory: A Plan for Success in Iraq&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Right Type of &quot;Surge&quot;: Any Troop Increase Must Be Large and Lasting&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Send More Troops to Baghdad and We’ll Have a Fighting Chance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;        A neo-conservative of the highest order, Kagan is an influential member of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_for_the_New_American_Century&quot;&gt;Project for the New American Century&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        So the question is, if Kagan is such an expert on military affairs and the Iraq insurgency, where did he get this expertise?  But before we address that question, I would like to note that I believe there are two primary means for obtaining information that would qualify one as an &quot;expert.&quot;  These are: 1.)  Substantial personal experience and 2.) Conducting scholarly research.  Thus, as an &quot;expert,&quot; we could assume Kagan has one or both of these concerning our current foreign policy predicament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        So let’s start from the top, using information that comes from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aei.org/docLib/20050928_FredKaganDCResume.pdf&quot;&gt;Kagan’s own Curriculum Vitae&lt;/a&gt;, as provided by his employer, AEI:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Experience, specifically, relevant military experience:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     &lt;br /&gt;      None.  Frederick Kagan has never donned a uniform or led troops in combat.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;        Okay, that’s no big deal.  Lots of people who’ve never served in the military are experts in the field of military strategy.  So let’s turn to Kagan’s education.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Education:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;         Kagan graduated in 1991 from Yale University with a B.A. in Soviet and East European Studies.  After graduating, he took on a position as an &quot;unsalaried intern&quot; at the Department of Defense, working for the Assistant Deputy Under-Secretary for Russian, Eurasian, and East European Affairs.  He worked on projects concerning the Russian army, Russia’s relations with the other former Soviet republics, and the development of the armies of those republics.  Kagan then headed back home to Yale for grad school, which he completed in 1995 by being awarded a Ph.D. in Russian and Soviet Military History.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;        Okay, so there’s not a lot there.  No study of the Middle East and no practical experience in the areas of Arab history or insurgencies.  As a student, it is clear that Kagan was focused primarily on the Cold War. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        But of course, many scholars eventually specialize in fields they didn’t study in school.  They do this through scholarly research &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; they’ve taken a position as a researcher or instructor at a university.  So maybe Kagan did the same after 1995.  Let’s take a look at his body of work—his research publications:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publications&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;        If you haven’t already looked at it, Kagan has a seven-page CV that lists his education and all of his publications.  This is fairly common for academics.  What makes Kagan’s different, is that virtually all of his work is &lt;strong&gt;not peer-reviewed&lt;/strong&gt; (or, &lt;strong&gt;refereed&lt;/strong&gt;).  For those who haven’t suffered through graduate school, this means that his work has little to no academic merit.  On &lt;a href=&quot;http://talkingpointsmemo.com/&quot;&gt;Talking Points Memo&lt;/a&gt; today, reader PS offers an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.talkingpointsmemo.com/archives/011921.php&quot;&gt;analysis&lt;/a&gt; of Kagan’s CV: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;From what I can tell, he has no serious background studying the issues that are at the core of his &quot;surge&quot; plan.  So I am completely baffled by the extent to which the media has given him credibility as a &quot;military expert&quot;....  His CV reveals no publications in refereed history or political science journals in the last decade.  Basically the intellectual architect of the surge is an op-ed/Weekly Standard writer whose only substantive expertise is on Napoleon. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;        For the most part, PS is correct.  However, I’ve gone through Kagan’s CV line-by-line and found some mistakes and some interesting points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        First, Kagan &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; actually authored four peer-reviewed journal articles since earning his Ph.D., though this is a paltry number for any respectable academic.  Three have been published in the last decade, but none have been published in the last nine years.  Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value=&quot;1995&quot;&gt;  &quot;The Evacuation of Soviet Industry in the Wake of ‘Barbarossa:’ A Key to the Soviet Victory,&quot; &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Slavic Military Studies&lt;/em&gt;, Volume 8, Number 2, pp. 387-414.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/97spring/kagan.htm&quot;&gt;1997.  &quot;Army Doctrine and Modern War: Notes toward a New Edition of FM 100-5,&quot; in &lt;em&gt;Parameters&lt;/em&gt;, Spring 1997.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://carlisle-www.army.mil/usawc/Parameters/98autumn/kagan.htm&quot;&gt;1998.  &quot;Star Wars in Real Life: Political Limitations on Space Warfare,&quot; &lt;em&gt;Parameters&lt;/em&gt;, Vol. XXVIII, No. 3, Autumn 1998, pp. 112-120.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt;&lt;li value=&quot;1998&quot;&gt;  &quot;Back to the Future: NSC-68 and the Right Course for America Today,&quot; &lt;em&gt;The SAIS Review&lt;/em&gt;, vol. XIX, no. 1 (Winter-Spring 1999), pp. 55-71.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt; &lt;p&gt;        Of course, these have nothing to do with insurgencies, Iraq, or the Middle East in general.  It should also be noted that, though they made it through the peer-review process, Kagan’s articles in &lt;em&gt;Parameters&lt;/em&gt; are very poorly researched and cited.  See for yourself.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        Kagan has also written chapters for several peer-reviewed books including &lt;em&gt;The Military History of Tsarist Russia&lt;/em&gt; in which he wrote chapters on the Napoleonic Era and the reign of Nicholas I (2002), &lt;em&gt;The Military History of the Soviet Union&lt;/em&gt; in which he wrote chapters on Soviet Operational Art and World War II after Stalingrad (2002), and &lt;em&gt;Reforming the Tsar’s Army&lt;/em&gt;, in which he wrote a chapter called &quot;Russian Military Reform in the Age of Napoleon&quot; (2004).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        That is the extent of Kagan’s scholarly work.  On the other hand, he has published a wealth of non-scholarly magazine articles (mostly for the Weekly Standard) and newspaper opinion pieces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;        Kagan is also relatively well known for his recently published book on Napoleon called &lt;em&gt;The End of the Old Order: Napoleon and Europe, 1801-1805&lt;/em&gt;.  Now, to me, that sounds academic.  Right?  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/dacapo/home.jsp&quot;&gt;Da Capo Press&lt;/a&gt; publishes it and they probably focus on military history.  Right?  Wrong.  Da Capo is not an academic press and it’s not associated with any scholarly institution.  In fact, here are some of Da Capo’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.perseusbooksgroup.com/dacapo/about_us.jsp&quot;&gt;latest titles&lt;/a&gt; on their web site:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some of our recent bestselling highlights, include Sport&#39;s Illustrated&#39;s #1 football book of all time, H.G.

Berry Brazelton&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Touchpoints&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Touchpoints Three to Six&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Children&#39;s Hospital Guide to Your Child&#39;s Health and Development&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Stanley Greenspan&#39;s &lt;em&gt;The Child with Special Needs&lt;/em&gt;, Dr. Mike Riera&#39;s popular &lt;em&gt;Field Guide to the American Teenager&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Staying Connected to Your Teenager&lt;/em&gt;, Bill Bridges&#39;s &quot;Transitions&quot; bestsellers, and the entire range of Your Pregnancy guides by Dr. Glade Curtis, and many more. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;        I invite anyone skeptical of anything I’ve written to check out the links I’ve provided, especially the one to Kagan’s CV.  Frederick Kagan is a fraud in that he espouses knowledge on military matters in Iraq that he does not have.  He has never served in the military and he has never conducted scholarly research on the Middle East, much less Iraq or Iraqi society.  And still, AEI &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aei.org/scholars/scholarID.99/scholar.asp&quot;&gt;maintains&lt;/a&gt; that Kagan &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;specializes in defense issues and the American military. In particular he studies defense transformation, the defense budget, and defense strategy and warfare. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; Yet I would like to see proof.  Where?  Where has Frederick Kagan ever specialized in defense issues and the American military?  I want to see it.  Young Americans are dying for it.  Where and when did he study defense transformation and strategy?  Was it during his &quot;unsalaried internship&quot; in 1992?  I want to know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      This is who the President of the United States listens to on Iraq--a student of Russian and Napoleonic history.  This is madness.  Frederick Kagan is an amateur who should be exposed and run out of Washington on a rail for all the damage he is doing to our nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;      I welcome comments from anyone who may have further information on this subject&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116882913832126379/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116882913832126379&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882913832126379'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882913832126379'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/scourge-of-kagans.html' title='The scourge of the Kagans'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116882632122848835</id><published>2007-01-15T01:37:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-14T20:58:41.630-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Attacking Iran</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/920715/sistani.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/524616/sistani.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sistani&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/13/weekinreview/14marsh.1024.1568.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/13/weekinreview/14marsh.1024.1568.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s really very simple.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Neocons plan to eliminate a phantom threat, Iraq with a single nuke, the Iranians can eliminate an entire army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does the WH and CENTCOM really think that Sistani and the Shia clerics will let bombs fall unhindered on Iran?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Have they considered the consequences of Sistani saying that an American attack on Iran is a cause for all Iraqi shia to wage jihad?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the Mahdi Army lays low, waiting for the US to get stupid and take them on, it seems no one has considered what happend if Bush bombs Iran.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iranians have planned this for years.

Todd Sommer, 23, with arsenic in 2002 so she could snare his $250,000 life insurance payout to finance the implants, shopping sprees and hard-partying lifestyle she craved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two months after her husband died, Sommer went under the knife, and she showed off her new bod to friends at the Marine Corps Air Station at Miramar, witnesses say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And instead of somberly mourning, she threw loud parties that brought military cops to her door and quickly began romancing another Marine, who is now her fiancé, witnesses say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as the twice-married mother of four stands trial in San Diego Superior Court this month, she&#39;s shielding her surgically enhanced chest from the jury with loose shirts and boxy suit jackets that make her look more like a bank clerk than a Black Widow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gone, too, is the bleached-blond hair she had in her 2005 mug shot. Her locks are back to natural brown and tied in a schoolgirlish pony tail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But no matter how prim she appears, Deputy District Attorney Laura Gunn alleges Sommer is a devious killer who slipped her husband a fatal dose of poison - possibly just hours after she consulted a plastic surgeon about getting her $5,400 boob job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broke Marine wife had just $280 in the bank and a $7-an-hour job at a Subway sandwich shop on Feb. 8, 2002, when she visited the plastic surgeon, Gunn told the jury in her opening statement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116883511845275599/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116883511845275599&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116883511845275599'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116883511845275599'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/marine-murdered-for-insurance.html' title='Marine murdered for insurance?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116882737085267442</id><published>2007-01-15T01:13:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-14T21:16:10.870-05:00</updated><title type='text'>WH lies</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.realcities.com/images/realcities/krwashington/16460/270945376020.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.realcities.com/images/realcities/krwashington/16460/270945376020.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The Shi&#39;ite Askariya shrine in Samarra, Iraq on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;June 23, 2003.

The violence in Iraq - particularly in Baghdad - overwhelmed the political gains Iraqis had made. Al-Qaida terrorists and Sunni insurgents recognized the mortal danger that Iraq&#39;s election posed for their cause. And they responded with outrageous acts of murder aimed at innocent Iraqis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;They blew up one of the holiest shrines in Shia Islam - the Golden Mosque of Samarra - in a calculated effort to provoke Iraq&#39;s Shia population to retaliate,&quot; Bush said. &quot;Their strategy worked. Radical Shia elements, some supported by Iran, formed death squads. And the result was a vicious cycle of sectarian violence that continues today.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That version of events helps to justify Bush&#39;s &quot;new way forward&quot; in Iraq, in which U.S. forces will largely target Sunni insurgents and leave it to Iraq&#39;s U.S.-backed Shiite government to - perhaps - disarm its allies in Shiite militias and death squads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the president&#39;s account understates by at least 15 months when Shiite death squads began targeting Sunni politicians and clerics. It also ignores the role that Iranian-backed Shiite groups had in death squad activities prior to the Samarra bombing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blaming the start of sectarian violence in Iraq on the Golden Dome bombing risks policy errors because it underestimates the depth of sectarian hatred in Iraq and overlooks the conflict&#39;s root causes. The Bush account also fails to acknowledge that Iranian-backed Iraqi Shiite groups stoked the conflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Bush met at the White House in November with the head of one of those groups: Abdul Aziz al-Hakim of the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq. SCIRI&#39;s Badr Organization militia is widely reported to have infiltrated Iraq&#39;s security forces and to be involved in death squad activities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice recited Bush&#39;s history of events on Thursday in fending off angry questioning from Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., about why Rice had offered optimistic testimony about Iraq during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in October 2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The president has talked repeatedly now about the changed circumstances that we faced after the Samarra bombing of February `06, because that bombing did in fact change the character of the conflict in Iraq,&quot; Rice said. &quot;Before that, we were fighting al-Qaida; before that, we were fighting some insurgents, some Saddamists.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She cited the version again in an appearance later that day before the House Foreign Affairs Committee. &quot;This is a direct result of al-Qaida activity,&quot; she said, asking House members not to consider Iraq&#39;s sectarian violence as evidence that Iraqis cannot live together.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush&#39;s national security adviser Stephen Hadley used the same version of events in an appearance Sunday on NBC&#39;s &quot;Meet the Press.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much like the administration&#39;s pre-war claims about Saddam&#39;s alleged ties to al-Qaida and purported nuclear weapons program, the claims about the bombing of the Shiite mosque in Samarra ignore inconvenient facts and highlight questionable but politically useful assumptions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one disagrees that the February bombing of the Golden Dome shrine was a pivotal moment. In the days following the attack, armed Shiites stormed Sunni mosques and neighborhoods, killing hundreds. Baghdad&#39;s Sunni residents responded by arming themselves, and Sunni insurgents set off car bombs in Shiite neighborhoods. By October, the monthly death toll was reaching into the thousands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. diplomats, reporters and military and intelligence officers began reporting that Shiite death squads were targeting Sunni clerics and former officials of Saddam Hussein&#39;s Sunni regime at least 15 months before the Samarra bombing.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116882737085267442/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116882737085267442&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882737085267442'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882737085267442'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/wh-lies.html' title='WH lies'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116882993880966095</id><published>2007-01-15T00:57:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-14T21:59:35.536-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Spocko v Disney</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/711346/Mickey-09.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/339402/Mickey-09.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/15/technology/15radio.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloggers Take on Talk Radio Hosts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By NOAM COHEN&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 15, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A San Francisco talk radio station pre-empted three hours of programming on Friday in response to a campaign by bloggers who have recorded extreme comments by several hosts and passed on digital copies to advertisers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The lead blogger, who uses the name Spocko, said that he and other bloggers had contacted more than 30 advertisers on KSFO-AM to inform them of comments made on the air and to ask them to pull their ads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The comments were also posted on Spocko’s Web site, spockosbrain.com. In response, ABC Radio Networks, which owns KSFO and which in turn is owned by the Walt Disney Company, sent letters to the site’s service provider, demanding the clips be taken down from its servers. The provider complied, raising the issue of what constitutes fair use of copyrighted material by a critic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an unusual cap to a simmering controversy, four talk radio hosts at KSFO-AM themselves played the clips on Friday, which had, in some cases, drawn national attention for language considered racially insensitive, religiously intolerant or containing violent imagery. The broadcast contained the occasional carefully measured apology for language that “could have been put more elegantly,” as one host, Melanie Morgan, described her comment — “We’ve got a bull’s eye painted on her big wide laughing eyes” — about Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, who is from San Francisco. “But Ms. Morgan added that her words were obviously a political metaphor that had to be distorted by critics to appear violent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. Morgan said that the on-air talent had “been reissued guidelines from the company about violent rhetoric and we’ve reviewed those rules and we don’t believe that we have crossed any single line.” But the hosts were uniformly defiant against the bloggers, who were called “crackpots with keyboards” and accused of using “guerrilla tactics.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spocko had recorded and disseminated other clips from the station in an effort to alarm advertisers. In one, Brian Sussman, an evening host on KSFO, described Senator Barack Obama, Democrat of Illinois, as a “halfrican,” because he has one African parent and one white parent. In another, from 2005, he challenged a caller who said he was not a Muslim to prove it by repeating back an insult to Allah. Mr. Sussman apologized for both comments during Friday’s three-hour show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In an interview, Spocko, who described himself as being in his “late 40s and a communications professional,” said he was appalled by what he heard on KSFO. Among the advertisers Spocko contacted, and who have been reported in The San Francisco Chronicle to have stopped advertising at KSFO were Bank of America, MasterCard and the Michigan Economic Development Corporation. During the Friday show, one of the hosts, Lee Rodgers, read an e-mail message asking if the station had lost any sponsors so the listener could, in turn, boycott the former sponsors. Ms. Morgan said “one advertiser — exactly one” had left the station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When reached at his office, KSFO-AM’s program director, Ken Berry, said he felt “the three-hour broadcast best spoke for us” and referred other questions to ABC. An ABC spokeswoman had no comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spocko’s campaign became more widely followed when his blog was taken down by his Internet service provider, 1&amp;1 Internet, of Chesterbrook, Pa., after ABC lawyers sent the company a cease and desist letter on Dec. 22.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1&amp;amp;1 says “the decision was made to remove the copyrighted material from our servers until the matter is resolved, whether by the parties involved or the judicial system.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spocko has since switched to a different Web hosting company. His lawyer, Matt Zimmerman of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit digital rights group based in San Francisco, says that 1&amp;amp;1 acted too quickly in response to the ABC letter, which he described as saber-rattling rather than a valid notice under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, an updating of copyright laws from 1998.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116882993880966095/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116882993880966095&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882993880966095'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882993880966095'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/spocko-v-disney.html' title='Spocko v Disney'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116882422094395850</id><published>2007-01-14T20:14:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-14T20:23:41.003-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Hey, it just happened</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/236483/harvard.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/858292/harvard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diaryTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diaryTitle&quot;&gt;Today&#39;s NYT: Downplaying A Rape At Harvard&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/hotlist/add/2007/1/14/161246/484/displaystory//&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/images/add_hl2.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Hotlist&quot; title=&quot;Hotlist&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://adam-b.dailykos.com/&quot;&gt;Adam B&lt;/a&gt;   [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/diary/Adam%20B&quot;&gt;Subscribe&lt;/a&gt;]  &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Sun Jan 14, 2007 at 01:12:46 PM PST&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;One standard feature of the Sunday Styles section of the New York Times (a/k/a, &quot;Women&#39;s Sports&quot;) is the &quot;Modern Love&quot; column, in which a contributor tells story of, well, love in the modern age.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Today&#39;s column is from Ashley Cross, a student at Columbia, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/14/fashion/14love.html?ex=157680000&amp;en=76cb222d7133a167&amp;amp;amp;amp;ei=5124&amp;partner=permalink&amp;amp;exprod=permalink&quot;&gt;who writes about learning that her boyfriend was accused of rape at Harvard&lt;/a&gt;.  Which, on its face, is an interesting story, but not when it&#39;s told in a way that minimizes the offense.  She says he said: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Driving back to camp he was uncharacteristically quiet, and later, in the privacy of my platform tent, he sat on my floor and told me he didn’t feel comfortable with our developing relationship unless I knew something about him.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It sounded so ominous; I couldn’t imagine what dark secrets he possessed. &quot;What?&quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He said it flat out: &quot;I’m on leave from college because a friend accused me of raping her.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I didn’t say anything at first. I was shocked, yes, but not frightened. We hadn’t yet slept together, and his physical advances so far bordered on old-fashioned. I ransacked my memory to recall if I had missed clues to his character or ways I might have misjudged him, but I came up empty....&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As I peppered him with questions, he talked me through the fateful night of only a few months before, when he and the girl, who’d been a friend, had mingled at a party and drifted off drunk together before winding up back in her room, where, several hours later, they had sex. She became hysterical, claiming he forced himself on her. He left, bewildered and distraught. That night he wrote her a letter apologizing for upsetting her and left it at her door. He told me the letter was an attempt to salvage the friendship.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Did you rape her?&quot; I asked.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;We had sex,&quot; he said. &quot;But I didn’t mean to hurt her, no.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Cross reads the accuser&#39;s statement, notes that her boyfriend had left Harvard voluntarily, and complains on how things proceeded from there: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;He knew the university was investigating the allegations and that he might face dismissal. What he didn’t know was that he soon would face consequences much more severe than being forced to leave school. Rather than allow the college administration to handle the situation, his accuser filed criminal charges. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Yes, I mean, God forbid that a victim should treat a crime like a crime, and a criminal as a criminal.  She wasn&#39;t accusing him of plagiarism; this was &lt;strong&gt;rape&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He ends up pleading guilty, accepting a plea bargain that called for him to spend 18 months under house arrest.  And most of the article is spent with Cross&#39; sympathy for him, that his life was ruined, and how her friends couldn&#39;t understand why she still supported him, and how eventually their relationship crumbled.  &quot;His ordeal will always haunt me,&quot; Cross writes. &quot;In my mind, he was not seeking to humiliate and subjugate a woman on that night many years ago. I believe he was a boy who endeavored for hours in the dark to express his drunken, fumbling desire in a way that, fair or not, ended up unraveling his life.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Well, &lt;strong&gt;boo-friggin&#39;-hoo. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Fumbling desire&quot;?  It takes about two minutes on Google, given the identifying facts she acknowledges in the article (rape + Harvard + letter + plea bargain), to find out what really happened here, facts that Times readers are not given thanks to the first-person nature of the piece.  &lt;a href=&quot;http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:rfeEb1h1gxcJ:www.thecrimson.harvard.edu/article.aspx%3Fref%3D96028+%22drew+douglas%22+harvard&amp;hl=en&amp;amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;amp;cd=46&quot;&gt;From the Harvard Crimson&lt;/a&gt; and the court records it reviewed, here&#39;s what D. Drew Douglas, once Harvard Class of 2000, did that night: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the court records, the prosecutor reads an account of the incident, after which [D. Drew] Douglas is recorded as saying, &quot;I admit to committing the crime.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;According to the account, both students had been friends for a year. On April 3, the night of the incident, the woman saw Douglas while on a date with another man.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The victim told The Crimson yesterday that she was &quot;feeling the effects of alcohol&quot; that night.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Court documents state that the three attended a party together. Afterwards, as her date walked her home, Douglas began walking along with the pair.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The other man left her at her dorm, but Douglas&quot; told her he wanted to go home with her,&quot; and stayed behind, prosecutors told the court.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;She told him that wasn&#39;t going to happen and was attempting to get into her door,&quot; the prosecutor told the court. &quot;The defendant was blocking access to the card key [reader] she needed to use.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;He followed her into the dorm and up the stairs. &quot;She repeatedly told him that he was not going to come in,&quot; the document states. &quot;The defendant kept telling her that it&#39;s his choice; she did not have input into that decision.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Outside her room he threw her against the wall, pushed her dress and grabbed her buttocks. He also began kissing her, the prosecutor said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;[She] told him to leave [and] was struggling to get away from him,&quot; the documents said.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She managed to open the door to her suite, but did not shut it in time to prevent Douglas from following her inside.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;Once she was inside, although annoyed that the defendant was still there, because she was a friend of the defendant, [she] wasn&#39;t particularly frightened,&quot; the prosecutor said. &quot;She told him to leave; she was going to bed.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;She lay down fully clothed on the bed and began to doze off. &quot;She next became aware that [Douglas] had removed all of his clothing and had gotten into bed with her,&quot; the document reads.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Once in bed with her, he proceeded to sexually assault her, though the court document does not describe any penetration. Some time later, the prosecutor said, Douglas left the bed....&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The prosecutor said the woman assaulted by Douglas found a handwritten note under her door the next day apologizing &quot;for pressuring her, forcing her to engage in these activities.&quot; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make no mistake of it; this was &lt;strong&gt;rape&lt;/strong&gt;, and Douglas deserved neither the sympathy of Ms. Cross nor the one-sided account she was allowed to publish in the Times today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116882422094395850/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116882422094395850&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882422094395850'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116882422094395850'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/hey-it-just-happened.html' title='Hey, it just happened'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116876272480708253</id><published>2007-01-14T03:27:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-14T04:09:23.520-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Why the fuck is he making military policy</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/596338/robert%20kagan.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/83566/robert%20kagan.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, I have a couple of hundred military history books.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, never, in my wildest dreams, would I look a bunch of 19 year olds in the face and say let&#39;s go take that building. Because I don&#39;t know the first thing about leading men in combat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why the fuck is the president listening to this fat motherfucker who wouldn&#39;t know how to load an M-4,  much less take one apart in the dark. If I had served with Jack Keane, I would call him a disgrace to the Army for allowing the president to listen to this assclown. I mean, I would fly to Washington, have lunch with him and say this shit to his face. No letter, no e-mail, face to fucking face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He would deserve that much consideration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Kagan has no business making war. None. He is so shitty at his chosen profession, he isn&#39;t even a tenured professor, but an assclown at a think tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the sick part is that people who know better are pushing this bullshit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, I respected Harry McMaster, until I realized he was bucking for a star. As a battlefield commander in the 1991 Gulf War, his personal courage was unquestioned. But when I read the self-serving bullshit he was pushing out about Tal Afar, shit his own men didn&#39;t believe, shit reporters exposed as bullshit, that he had gotten rid of the terrorists. Hell, the Shia were calling for the Wolf Brigade to kill the Turkomen and Sunnis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead of pushing this shit, he should have retired to oppose this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he picked the wrong branch. Back in the day, Armored Cav was the shit,  going up the Fulda Gap, it was a good job, but times change. The future of that branch is Strikers and armored cars, not M-1&#39;s and Bradleys. So what&#39;s a man to do?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He refashions himself as a counterinsurgency expert. Which he accomplished by driving a tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone at JSOC has had a good laugh over this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have this fat piece of shit, Kagan, pushing a plan, supported by people who lost their fucking minds  or never had them to begin with. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petraeus is either an optimist or hid his Courtney Massingale side until late in his career.  Even though I was not a fan of the way Charles Swannick led the 82nd in Iraq, he, John Baptiste and Paul Eaton are so morally and ethically above him it&#39;s shocking. They had the decency to retire and tell the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, a lot of the hype about Petraeus comes from Rick Atkinson, who between his history of the Army in WWII, did go to Iraq.  But he&#39;s mostly a light infantry guy, with some leg infantry time. But mostly he was 101 and 82nd. He is no SF type. Yet, he was allow to toss out the parts he didn&#39;t like.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, JSOC had people rolling their eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How the fuck is Ray Odierno in command of anything besides his lawn mower. His command of the 4th ID was a disgrace. You have Buford Blount, who successfully led the 3ID nearly cashiered for asking too many questions during the drive to Baghdad, and you have Odierno, who&#39;s battalion commanders sucked, one being a raving lunatic who sought out ambushes, now running the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odierno should have been forced to retire. Period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When will someone like Wes Clark or Tony Zinni put the cards on the table and say the obvious: why the fuck are you listening to Robert fucking Kagan.  They are embarassing the Army and their chosen profession by listening to this fucking moron. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I mean, have they no pride? No respect for their own profession? Robert Kagan sits in a room and makes shit up. He has no experience in war. To take his advice seriously should draw the scorn of their peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is akin to taking a health care analyst and telling him to remove a bullet. Kagan writes books. He has no business making military policy. None, and Odierno and Petraeus should be ashmed as professional military men to take his idiotic fucking advice.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116876272480708253/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116876272480708253&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116876272480708253'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116876272480708253'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-fuck-is-he-making-military-policy.html' title='Why the fuck is he making military policy'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116875905474916737</id><published>2007-01-14T02:55:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-14T02:24:13.753-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Favorite Egg recipe</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/821803/eggs.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/753467/eggs.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was laying in bed thinking about Robert Kagan making military policy and was so enraged, I got up. But before I launch into my rant about him, I was thinking about breakfast.  My landlord gave me a new stove, the fucker is huge, and I ordered some crossaints from Fresh Direct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve been shaking a cold and just didn&#39;t want to deal with the local supermarket, or a trip to Fairway.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the recipe recommended by Richard Olney and other French food afficionatos.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chowhound.com/topics/308609&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;title entry-title&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chowhound.com/topics/308609&quot;&gt;               Making perfect scrambled eggs [thread digression moved from General Topics board]&lt;/a&gt;           &lt;/h3&gt;      &lt;p class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;entry-content&quot;&gt; Btw, the way I learned the technique was James Peterson&#39;s &quot;Glorious French Food&quot; -- for that one recipe I was eternally grateful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A short-hand approach would run something like:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beat some very fresh, high-quality eggs loosely with a fork. Slide them into the top part of a double boiler (or a pan atop a pot) which is set above -- but not touching -- an inch or two of barely simmering water. Begin whisking immediately, breaking up the lumps that form. When the eggs have developed a thick, cottage-cheese-like texture, add slivers of cold unsalted butter (a few tablespoons is not unreasonable; the point is to slow the cooking down and capture bits of butter in the egg emulsion -- slow and steady wins the race), continue mixing until the eggs are about 80-90% cooked, remove from stove and continue mixing to nearly finish cooking them off the heat, and serve over hot buttered or dry toast (I prefer dry), garnished with good salt and garnishes of your choice. Make sure the plate is not cold (but hot would not been good either). If you find the cooking going too fast, you can also use some cold heavy cream to slow things down. Takes 20-30 minutes &lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But who actually fixes eggs like this? I don&#39;t own a copper pot, like Olney. What I tend to do is use butter and a little cheese to get that soft texture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, it&#39;s time to share your egg recipes.

Lou Fintor, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, would not say which company the shooter worked for. Two independent sources have told The Virginian-Pilot that he worked for Blackwater, based in Moyock, N.C.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When asked about the reports, Anne Tyrrell, a Blackwater spokeswoman, said Wednesday: &quot;No comment.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blackwater provides security for U.S. diplomatic staff in Iraq under a multimillion-dollar State Department contract.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Details of the shooting are sketchy. Fintor said there are conflicting reports. &quot;We continue looking into the incident in an effort to try to determine the facts,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He declined to provide any further details about the American contractor, citing the U.S. Privacy Act. However, a former Blackwater contractor and an executive of another private military company, citing sources inside Iraq, independently said that the shooter was a Blackwater contractor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, there is no word of any criminal charges being brought in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly four years after the U.S. invasion, tens of thousands of civilian contractors are working in Iraq. So far, none has been charged with any criminal wrongdoing. One reason: Contractors operate in a legal gray area, in which it&#39;s uncertain whether they&#39;re subject to civilian law, military law or neither.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest effort to clear that up came Wednesday when U.S. Rep. David Price, D-N.C., introduced legislation he says will bring about transparency, accountability and coordination for private contractors operating in a war zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The lack of a legal framework for battlefield contracting has allowed certain rogue contractor employees to perpetrate heinous criminal acts without the threat of prosecution,&quot; Price said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116875933146357434/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116875933146357434&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116875933146357434'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116875933146357434'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/mercenary-murder-in-iraq.html' title='Mercenary murder in Iraq?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116875380191307808</id><published>2007-01-14T00:46:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-14T00:50:01.983-05:00</updated><title type='text'>I told you this would happen</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/799870/turkish%20Army.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/944035/turkish%20Army.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L12896544.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turk PM asserts right to intervene in Iraq, raps US&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;12 Jan 2007 17:57:24 GMT&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;ANKARA, Jan 12 (Reuters) - Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan on Friday reaffirmed Turkey&#39;s right to send troops into Iraq to crush Kurdish rebels there and chided U.S. officials for questioning it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The Turkish Republic will do whatever is necessary to combat the terrorists when the time comes, but it will not announce its plans in advance,&quot; Erdogan told a news conference after a meeting of his ruling AK Party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We say we are ready to take concrete steps with the Iraqi government and we also say these steps must be taken now.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In sharp language underscoring Turkish anxiety about the chaos in Iraq, Erdogan said it was wrong for Washington -- &quot;our supposed strategic ally&quot; -- to tell Turkey, with its historic and cultural ties in the region, to stay out of Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We have a 350 km border with Iraq.

The rubber plantations and tin mining industries had pushed for the use of the term &quot;emergency&quot; since their losses would not have been covered by Lloyds insurers if it had been termed a &quot;war&quot;. The MNLA commonly employed hit and run guerrilla tactics, sabotaging installations, attacking rubber plantations and destroying transportation and infrastructure.[1]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support for the MRLA was mainly based on around 500,000 ethnic Chinese then living in Malaya (there were 3.12 million Chinese in total); the ethnic Malay population for the most part did not support them. The MNLA raised the support of the Chinese because they were denied the equal right to vote in elections, had no land rights to speak of, and were usually very poor. The MNLA&#39;s agents within the Chinese community were known as &quot;Min Yuen.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MNLA had its hideouts in the rather inaccessible tropical jungle with limited infrastructure. Most MNLA guerrillas were ethnic Chinese, though there were some Malays, Indonesians and Indians among its members. They were organized into communist political regiments with political sections, commissars, instructors and secret service. They also had lectures about Marxism-Leninism, and had political newsletters to be distributed to the locals. MNLA also stipulated that their soldiers had to get official permission for any romantic involvement with local women.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the international scene, the emerging Korean War eclipsed the developing conflict in Malaya. Part of the British attempt at resolving the situation was the implementation of the so-called &quot;Briggs&#39; Plan&quot; which meant the resettlement of people — especially 400,000 Chinese — living in jungle areas to the relative safety of new, partially fortified villages with full round-the-clock armed sentries. People resented this at first but some soon became content with the better living standards in the villages. They were given money and ownership of the land they lived on. Removing a population which might be sympathetic to guerrillas was a counter-insurgency technique which the British had used before, notably against the Boer Commandos in the Second Boer War (1899–1902).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the start of the Emergency, the British had a total of 13 infantry battalions, comprising seven partly-formed Gurkha battalions, three British battalions, two battalions of the Royal Malay Regiment and a British Royal Artillery Regiment being utilised as infantry[2]. This force was too small to effectively meet the threat of the &quot;Communist Terrorists&quot; or &quot;Bandits&quot;, and more infantry battalions were needed in Malaya.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The British brought in soldiers from units like the Worcestershire Regiment, Royal Marines and King&#39;s African Rifles. Another effort was a re-formation of the Special Air Service as a specialised reconnaissance, raiding and counter-insurgency unit in 1950. The Permanent Secretary of Defence for Malaya, Sir Robert Thompson, had served in the Chindits in Burma during World War II, which meant that his vast experience in jungle warfare may have proved valuable during this period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1951, some British army units began a &quot;hearts and minds campaign&quot; by giving medical and food aid to Malays and indigenous Sakai tribes. At the same time, they put pressure on MNLA by patrolling the jungle. Units such as the SAS, the Royal Marines and Gurkha Brigade drove MNLA guerrillas deeper into the jungle and denied them resources. The MRLA had to extort food from the Sakai and earned their enmity. Many of the captured guerrillas changed sides. In comparison, the MRLA never released any Britons alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;In the end the conflict involved up to a maximum of 40,000 British and Commonwealth troops against a peak of about 7–8,000 communist guerrillas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On October 7, 1951, the MNLA ambushed and killed the British High Commissioner, Sir Henry Gurney. The killing has been described as a major factor in causing the Malayan psyche to roundly reject the MRLA campaign, and also as leading to widespread fear due to the perception that &quot;if even the High Commissioner was no longer safe, there was little hope of protection and safety for the man-in-the-street in Malaya.&quot;[3] More recently, MNLA leader Chin Peng has, by contrast, said that the killing had little effect, and that the communists anyway radically altered their strategy that month in their &#39;October Resolutions&#39;. These responded to the Briggs Plan by reducing unit sizes, increasing jungle farming, and attempting to boost political work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gurney&#39;s successor, Lieutenant General Gerald Templer was instructed by the British government to push for immediate measures to give ethnic Chinese residents the right to vote. He also pursued the Briggs&#39;s Plan, and sped up the formation of a Malayan army. At the same time he made it clear that the emergency itself was the main impediment to accelerating decolonisation. He also instituted financial rewards for detecting guerrillas by any civilians and expanded the intelligence network (Special Branch).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia was willing to send troops to help a SEATO ally and the first Australian ground forces, the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2RAR), arrived in 1955.[4] The battalion would later be replaced by 3RAR, which would in turn be replaced by 1RAR.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Realising that his conflict has not come to any fruition, Chin Peng sought a referendum with the ruling British government alongside many Malayan officials at Baling in 1955. The meeting was clearly intended to pursue a mutual end to the conflict but led by Tunku Abdul Rahman, representing the Malayan government at the Baling Talks, all of Chin Peng&#39;s demands were dismissed. As a result, the conflict would appear to have been heightened and in response, New Zealand sent NZSAS soldiers, No. 14 Squadron RNZAF and later No. 75 Squadron RNZAF, and other Commonwealth members also sent troops to aid the British.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the independence of Malaya under Prime Minister Tunku Abdul Rahman on August 31, 1957, the insurrection lost its rationale as a war of colonial liberation. The last serious resistance from MRLA guerrillas ended with a surrender in the Telok Anson marsh area in 1958. The remaining MRLA forces fled to the Thai border and further east.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On July 31, 1960, the Malayan government declared the Emergency was over, and Chin Peng left south Thailand for Beijing where he was accommodated by the Chinese authorities in the International Liaison Bureau, where many other Southeast Asian Communist Party leaders were housed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the conflict security forces killed 6,710 MRLA guerrillas and captured 1,287. Of the total number of guerrillas, 2,702 surrendered during the conflict and about 500 at the end of the conflict. There were 1,346 Malayan troops and 519 British military personnel killed. 2,478 civilians were killed and 810 recorded missing as a result of the conflict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;[edit] Comparisons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the conflicts in Malaya and Vietnam differed on many points in so far as the details of their wars, it has been asked time and again by historians as to how a British force of 35,000 succeeded where over a half million soldiers of the U.S. and others failed. One of the main points that differentiated the two was that the MRLA never had a dependable ally close at hand like the Viet Cong did with the North Vietnamese Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another key point was the effectiveness of the Malayan Police Special Branch against the political arm of the guerilla movement[5][6].&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The MNLA was also, as mentioned above, a political movement almost entirely limited to ethnic Chinese; support among Muslim Malayans and smaller tribes was scattered if existent at all. The British war effort never suffered from anything approaching the criticism that hammered the U.S. in Vietnam, and the USSR and China were too involved in Korea to give serious aid to the MNLA. Also, many Malayans had fought side by side with the British against the Japanese occupation in World War II, including Chin Peng. This is in contrast to Indochina (Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia) where French colonial officials often operated as proxies and collaborators to the Japanese. This factor of trust between the locals and the colonials was what gave the British an advantage over the French and later, the Americans in Vietnam; Commonwealth troops saw ordinary civilians as allies, not enemies.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116875340465975389/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116875340465975389&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116875340465975389'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116875340465975389'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/mayalan-emergency.html' title='The Mayalan Emergency'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116875276558503662</id><published>2007-01-14T00:30:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-14T00:32:45.603-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Black life means nothing  to Lieberman</title><content type='html'>&lt;h2&gt;           &lt;a class=&quot;post-title&quot; href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/01/13/pride-trumps-all/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent Link to Pride Trumps All&quot;&gt;             Pride Trumps All          &lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/h2&gt;          &lt;!-- Print the time the article was posted --&gt;          &lt;div class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/index.php?author=1&quot;&gt;Jane Hamsher&lt;/a&gt; @ 1:14 pm&lt;/div&gt;          &lt;!-- The article content --&gt;         &lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;           &lt;p&gt; &lt;img id=&quot;image5705&quot; src=&quot;http://static.firedoglake.com/2006/11/9641a81a-30a9-48b7-9efb-40b4de496879.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;9641a81a-30a9-48b7-9efb-40b4de496879.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/01/12/lieberman-punts-on-katrina-time-to-speak-out/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/01/12/lieberman-punts-on-katrina-time-to-speak-out/&quot;&gt;As C&amp;amp;L says&lt;/a&gt;, people need to speak out about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16585614/site/newsweek/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sen. Joe Lieberman,  the only Democrat to endorse President Bush’s new plan for Iraq, has quietly backed away from his pre-election demands that the White House turn over potentially embarrassing documents relating to its handling of the Hurricane Katrina disaster in New Orleans. Senator Joe Lieberman has just taken the very surprising step of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16585614/site/newsweek/&quot;&gt;revealing to &lt;em&gt;Newsweek&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that he will &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; use his chairmanship on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://hsgac.senate.gov/&quot;&gt;Homeland Security committee&lt;/a&gt; to aggressively probe the government&#39;s catastrophic failings in the wake of Hurricane Katrina.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;There&#39;s no excuse for this other than to spit in the face of Democrats who Joe doesn&#39;t feel supported him in his moment of need, because after all that is what is most important in the situation.

Remember the traditional Irish music of Tommy Makem and the Clancy Brothers? That Tommy Makem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;My aunts and my mother’s cousins and my cousins used to make such a regular habit of being there on Thursday nights (there was live music Thursday through Sunday and Thursday was the least crowded) that there was a table permanently reserved for our family each Thursday.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Depending on the route I took home, I might get off the subway at Lexington Ave. and walk over to 3rd to catch an express bus home and that would take me right past the Irish Pavilion. As you can imagine, I would often stop in of a Thursday to have a pint and say Hi to the fams.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During my second year of law school I developed pneumonia but tried to keep on at school. I had been invited onto a law review and the workload from that in addition to my course work was crushing. I did not want to fall behind.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One night, I was walking past the Irish Pavilion, too exhausted I thought to make it to 3rd Avenue and wondering if I had the strength to get home when I realized – it was Thursday! I went to the door of the Irish Pavilion, there was line out onto the pavement. But I shoved by a bit and caught the eye of Declan the matre’d . He took one look at me, all flushed and glassy eyed with fever, and pulled me in saying, “I’ll get Tommy.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I went back to the family table and, thank heavens, there along with a mess of cousins and second cousins was my Aunt Vera. I was saved. A minute later, Tommy came out of the kitchen with a steaming mug, said “you must do as you Uncle Tommy tells you now”, and ordered me to drink its contents. Although Tommy was not really my uncle, he said it would save my life, so I sipped it down.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am still alive, so I guess he was right. The hot toddy recipe is one I have come back to for more colds, flus and bronchitis than you can shake a stick at. It never fails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an Irish Coffee mug or similar container, put:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;1 tablespoon of honey&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; 1/6 of a lemon (no more, not less) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1 clove (stuck in the rind of the lemon. Avoid the temptation to add more cloves) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;1 shot of Jameson’s Irish Whiskey (Bushmill’s doesn’t work as well, I cannot figure out why) &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;fill to the top with boiling water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Breathe the vapors until it is cool enough to sip. Then, sip and breathe until finished. You will feel so comforted and have the most restorative night’s sleep. I have also used it prophylacticly to avoid illness when I have been soaked with icy mud during the odd early spring rugby match. There is nothing like the combination of hot bath and Tommy’s toddy to ward off the effects of the cold .&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, now that it is colds and flu season and with the weird weather we have been having, maybe we should expect more, we may need lots more home remedies. What traditional remedies have you used in your family? For that matter, does anybody else have a great hot toddy recipe? How about a favorite cold weather meal recipe? Something for after the snow shoveling, or better still, something for those nights when you have to commute home in freezing rain?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116875254676690033/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116875254676690033&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116875254676690033'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116875254676690033'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/weird-weather-cures.html' title='Weird weather cures'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116873309145608075</id><published>2007-01-13T18:56:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-13T19:04:51.526-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Are you kidding?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics.boston.com/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2004/01/03/1073138501_5459.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics.boston.com/bonzai-fba/Globe_Photo/2004/01/03/1073138501_5459.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Didn&#39;t we try this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-na-military11jan11,1,32607,full.story?coll=la-headlines-frontpage&quot;&gt;&#39;Gated communities&#39; planned for Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New U.S. strategy calls for creating zones of safety in the Iraqi capital, then working outward.&lt;br /&gt;By Julian E. Barnes, Times Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;January 11, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON — The military&#39;s new strategy for Iraq envisions creating &quot;gated communities&quot; in Baghdad — sealing off discrete areas and forcibly removing insurgents, then stationing American units in the neighborhood to keep the peace and working to create jobs for residents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The U.S. so far has found it impossible to secure the sprawling city. But by focusing an increased number of troops in selected neighborhoods, the military hopes it can create islands of security segregated from the chaos beyond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The gated communities plan has been tried — with mixed success — in other wars. In Vietnam, the enclaves were called &quot;strategic hamlets&quot; and were a spectacular failure. But counterinsurgency experts say such zones can work if, after the barriers are established, the military follows up with neighborhood sweeps designed to flush out insurgents and militia fighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strategy, described in broad terms by current and former Defense Department officials, is an attempt to re-create the success military units have had in smaller Iraqi cities, most notably Tall Afar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the last two years, the military has been focused primarily on training Iraqi security forces. But under the new plan, the primary mission of American combat forces in Baghdad will be to protect Iraqis living in the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;In counterinsurgency, by now we have all figured out, the population is the prize,&quot; said a Defense official who, like others, spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the program are not final.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critics of the troop increase President Bush announced Wednesday have said the sheer size of Baghdad, with nearly 6 million people, makes it impossible to replicate the Tall Afar strategy. But counterinsurgency experts say the gated communities concept — a name taken from the walled-off suburban developments in America — is a way to concentrate troops on smaller sections of the capital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;You do it neighborhood by neighborhood,&quot; said the Defense official. &quot;Think of L.A. Let&#39;s say we take West Hollywood and gate it off. Or Anaheim. Or central Los Angeles. You control that area first and work out from there.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Baghdad neighborhood could be sealed off by using a highway or a river as a barrier, or by creating roadblocks and checkpoints between neighborhoods, counterinsurgency experts said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is amazing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They keep citing the British in Malaya, but the chinese were a minority and the MRLA had little support outside their own community. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, the British had many more soldiers than the MRLA. Even then the war took 12 years.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116873309145608075/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116873309145608075&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116873309145608075'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116873309145608075'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/are-you-kidding.html' title='Are you kidding?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116869686686373442</id><published>2007-01-13T08:55:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-13T09:01:06.880-05:00</updated><title type='text'>You have to be kidding</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/dayart/20070111/45034175_PI_05-24-2006.GJRMN0OP.1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/dayart/20070111/45034175_PI_05-24-2006.GJRMN0OP.1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/299253_inconvenient11.html&quot;&gt;Federal Way schools restrict Gore film&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Inconvenient Truth&#39; called too controversial&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By ROBERT McCLURE AND LISA STIFFLER&lt;br /&gt;P-I REPORTERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;NOTE: This story has been altered since it was originally published. The computer program Al Gore uses to present scientists’ findings in the movie “An Inconvenient Truth” is Keynote. A competing software program’s name was mentioned in the earlier version of the story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This week in Federal Way schools, it got a lot more inconvenient to show one of the top-grossing documentaries in U.S. history, the global-warming alert &quot;An Inconvenient Truth.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a parent who supports the teaching of creationism and opposes sex education complained about the film, the Federal Way School Board on Tuesday placed what it labeled a moratorium on showing the film. The movie consists largely of a computer presentation by former Vice President Al Gore recounting scientists&#39; findings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Al Gore&#39;s documentary about global warming may not be shown unless the teacher also presents an &quot;opposing view.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Condoms don&#39;t belong in school, and neither does Al Gore. He&#39;s not a schoolteacher,&quot; said Frosty Hardison, a parent of seven who also said that he believes the Earth is 14,000 years old. &quot;The information that&#39;s being presented is a very cockeyed view of what the truth is. ... The Bible says that in the end times everything will burn up, but that perspective isn&#39;t in the DVD.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hardison&#39;s e-mail to the School Board prompted board member David Larson to propose the moratorium Tuesday night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Somebody could say you&#39;re killing free speech, and my retort to them would be we&#39;re encouraging free speech,&quot; said Larson, a lawyer. &quot;The beauty of our society is we allow debate.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;School Board members adopted a three-point policy that says teachers who want to show the movie must ensure that a &quot;credible, legitimate opposing view will be presented,&quot; that they must get the OK of the principal and the superintendent, and that any teachers who have shown the film must now present an &quot;opposing view.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The requirement to represent another side follows district policy to represent both sides of a controversial issue, board President Ed Barney said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What is purported in this movie is, &#39;This is what is happening. Period. That is fact,&#39; &quot; Barney said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Students should hear the perspective of global-warming skeptics and then make up their minds, he said. After they do, &quot;if they think driving around in cars is going to kill us all, that&#39;s fine, that&#39;s their choice.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Are you fucking kidding me? ONE e-mail from a lunatic can stop this film from being shown? The school board should be ashamed of itself and the parents should be raising  holy hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;14,000 years old?

Gen. Abud Qanbar.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appointment is highly significant because it is Maliki&#39;s first public move after President Bush&#39;s announcement that he was sending more troops to Iraq. The prime mission of those troops is to reduce violence in Baghdad, much of which is blamed on sectarian fighters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Iraqi commander for the capital, Qanbar would play a central role in that campaign, and any ties he might have to sectarian groups could undermine the new U.S. effort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his speech Wednesday, in which he announced the troop increase, Bush said political and sectarian interference in security matters would no longer be tolerated.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;If the Iraqi government does not follow through on its promises, it will lose the support of the American people,&quot; Bush said. &quot;The prime minister understands this.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maliki&#39;s decision to push through his own choice for one of the country&#39;s most sensitive military posts — and to reject another officer who was considered more qualified by the top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey — has renewed questions about the prime minister&#39;s intentions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a delicate situation,&quot; said Mahmoud Othman, a Kurdish lawmaker who questioned the choice of Qanbar. &quot;It&#39;s very dangerous if it turns out that he has affiliations,&quot; he said, naming Maliki&#39;s political party and the anti-American Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada Sadr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. officials are skeptical of Qanbar not only because of the way he was named, but because they know little about him. Moreover, they have questioned the degree to which Maliki&#39;s government is reliant on sectarian figures, particularly Sadr. Maliki essentially is asking American officials to take Qanbar on trust at a time when they have little left.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Qanbar, a commander in the navy during Saddam Hussein&#39;s reign, has not worked with American military officials, who say they know little about him other than that he hails from Amarah, a city in Iraq&#39;s Shiite-dominated south, and that he was taken prisoner by American forces near Kuwait during the 1991 Persian Gulf War.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. commanders have said that officials in Maliki&#39;s government have intervened several times to block them from combating Sadr&#39;s Al Mahdi militia, which is accused of being behind much of the bloodshed in Baghdad. When U.S. forces did raid the militia&#39;s stronghold of Sadr City, a largely Shiite neighborhood of east Baghdad, Maliki&#39;s government publicly criticized them. On several occasions, Maliki ordered the release of suspected militiamen captured there, frustrating U.S. commanders.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116869615799782722/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116869615799782722&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116869615799782722'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116869615799782722'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/he-has-affliliations.html' title='He  has affliliations'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116867075354485573</id><published>2007-01-13T01:18:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-13T01:45:53.640-05:00</updated><title type='text'>You bet your life</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/884173/aaaaa.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;down&quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot; id=&quot;formatbar_Bold&quot; title=&quot;Bold&quot; onmouseover=&quot;ButtonHoverOn(this);&quot; onmouseout=&quot;ButtonHoverOff(this);&quot; onmouseup=&quot;&quot; onmousedown=&quot;CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton(&#39;richeditorframe&#39;, this, 3);ButtonMouseDown(this);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/99261/aaaaa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;I wonder if there is any crossover?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/12/AR2007011202217.html&quot;&gt;Battling With Sadr for Iraqi Soldiers&#39; Hearts&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Nancy Trejos&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;Saturday, January 13, 2007; Page A01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD -- The Iraqi soldiers broke into chants to commemorate the 86th anniversary of the creation of their army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Muhammad, Haider, Fatima, Hasan and Husayn!&quot; shouted a group of dancing soldiers, bellowing the names of the prophet and other long-dead Islamic icons revered by Shiite Muslims.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;U.S. troops with the team training the Iraqi army&#39;s 2nd Brigade, 6th Division patrol a Baghdad neighborhood. Most of the Iraqis they work with are Shiites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saddam Hussein was hanged Dec. 30, 2006, after an Iraqi tribunal found him guilty of crimes against humanity. Get background, photos and video about Hussein&#39;s rise to power and ultimate fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second later, the name of a living Shiite figure came out of the din. &quot;Moqtada! Moqtada!&quot; one soldier exclaimed, invoking the name of Moqtada al-Sadr, the radical Shiite cleric and leader of the Mahdi Army militia that American officials blame for many of the worst acts of violence in Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standing quietly in the crowd were four U.S. Army officers, there to represent the team of American soldiers advising the Iraqis. &quot;Sounds like the Mahdi militia is in the tent,&quot; said their interpreter, Mohammed Noshi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Moments before the chanting began, at a rally last Saturday morning at the soldiers&#39; shared base in eastern Baghdad, a brigade commander in the Iraqi army&#39;s 6th Division had called the troops the &quot;hope of this country.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Some people are trying to create sectarian violence to divide this country,&quot; said the colonel, who asked that his name not be published out of fear for his life. &quot;It is our job to keep this country in one piece.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At best, said several U.S. soldiers interviewed at the base this month, some of the Iraqi troops they advise are sympathetic to Sadr and his army. At worst, they said, some are members of the militia, also known as Jaish al-Mahdi. Despite the uneasiness of the alliance, 100 U.S. troops and 500 Iraqi soldiers have conducted joint raids and shared a base on the eastern side of the Tigris River, once a mixed area that is becoming predominantly Shiite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Training Iraq&#39;s police and army to the point where they can operate on their own is key to any reduction of U.S. forces, American commanders have said. Five thousand U.S. troops are already embedded with Iraqi units as advisers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. military officers say that the Iraqi police force is deeply infiltrated by militiamen and predict that the army will be quicker to operate independently. But a four-day visit to the base known as Old MOD, for the former Ministry of Defense complex, showed that the army is not immune to the militias&#39; influence. According to the Americans, most of the Iraqi soldiers are Shiites, and some come from Sadr City, a sprawling Baghdad slum that is a Mahdi Army stronghold. Some carry pictures of Sadr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Does it mean that they&#39;re Jaish al-Mahdi? No,&quot; said Lt. Col. Edward Taylor, head of the U.S. military transition team, which is attached to the 2nd Infantry Division&#39;s 2nd Brigade, based at Fort Carson, Colo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If he is wrong, his soldiers will die.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116867075354485573/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116867075354485573&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116867075354485573'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116867075354485573'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/you-bet-your-life.html' title='You bet your life'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116866874323499414</id><published>2007-01-13T01:07:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-13T01:12:23.266-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Nothing like Vietnam</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/398861/1051.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/740194/1051.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1989397,00.html&quot;&gt;The jihad now is against the Shias, not the Americans&lt;/a&gt;&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As 20,000 more US troops head for Iraq, Ghaith Abdul-Ahad, the only correspondent reporting regularly from behind the country&#39;s sectarian battle lines, reveals how the Sunni insurgency has changed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saturday January 13, 2007&lt;br /&gt;The Guardian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;An Iraqi man who was stopped by US troops while driving a car loaded with weapons in Ramadi, a Sunni-dominated area, is questioned by soldiers&lt;br /&gt;An Iraqi man who was stopped by US troops while driving a car loaded with weapons in Ramadi, a Sunni-dominated area, is questioned by soldiers. Photograph: Chris Hondros/Getty Images&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One morning a few weeks ago I sat in a car talking to Rami, a thick-necked former Republican Guard commando who now procures arms for his fellow Sunni insurgents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rami was explaining how the insurgency had changed since the first heady days after the US invasion. &quot;I used to attack the Americans when that was the jihad. Now there is no jihad. Go around and see in Adhamiya [the notorious Sunni insurgent area] - all the commanders are sitting sipping coffee; it&#39;s only the young kids that are fighting now, and they are not fighting Americans any more, they are just killing Shia. There are kids carrying two guns each and they roam the streets looking for their prey. They will kill for anything, for a gun, for a car and all can be dressed up as jihad.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rami was no longer involved in fighting, he said, but made a tidy profit selling weapons and ammunition to men in his north Baghdad neighbourhood. Until the last few months, the insurgency got by with weapons and ammunition looted from former Iraqi army depots. But now that Sunnis were besieged in their neighbourhoods and fighting daily clashes with the better-equipped Shia ministry of interior forces, they needed new sources of weapons and money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He told me that one of his main suppliers had been an interpreter working for the US army in Baghdad. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;He had a deal with an American officer. We bought brand new AKs and ammunition from them.&quot; He claimed the American officer, whom he had never met but he believed was a captain serving at Baghdad airport, had even helped to divert a truckload of weapons as soon as it was driven over the border from Jordan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These days Rami gets most of his supplies from the new American-equipped Iraqi army. &quot;We buy ammunition from officers in charge of warehouses, a small box of AK-47 bullets is $450 (£230). If the guy sells a thousand boxes he can become rich and leave the country.&quot; But as the security situation deteriorates, Rami finds it increasingly difficult to travel across Baghdad. &quot;Now I have to pay a Shia taxi driver to bring the ammo to me. He gets $50 for each shipment.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116866874323499414/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116866874323499414&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116866874323499414'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116866874323499414'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/nothing-like-vietnam.html' title='Nothing like Vietnam'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116864303036734319</id><published>2007-01-12T17:43:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-12T18:03:51.076-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Beckham in America</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/sports/soccer/12beckham.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sports&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/11/sports/soccer/beckham.2.650.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Beckham&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/sports/soccer/12beckham.html?_r=1&amp;ref=sports&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;A Soccer Star Heeds Lure of Hollywood&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By LYNN ZINSER and SARAH LYALL&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;David Beckham has never been simply a sports star. He is a brand, and one who briefly lived at the spot where fashion, celebrity and soccer met. The soccer component of that equation has eroded, but his star power still reverberates worldwide, so much that Major League Soccer has lured Beckham to Los Angeles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beckham will make the move from Real Madrid, the most glamorous team in Europe, and the United States’ top professional soccer league will try to cash in on his celebrity appeal — and perhaps that of his wife, Victoria, the former Posh Spice of the Spice Girls pop group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Los Angeles Galaxy announced the move yesterday, saying that Beckham would make $250 million over the five years of his deal, including endorsement income; the team did not release his actual salary from the club. Beckham will join the Galaxy after his contract with Real Madrid expires on June 30, coming to a league that has struggled for 11 years to gain prominence on the American sports landscape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Beckham, whose time as a world-class midfielder has passed, the move may be a savvy exit strategy from the intense European soccer spotlight. The British news media, ever eager to pounce on weakness, have been particularly savage about Posh and Becks, as they are called in Britain, since his meager performance as England’s captain in the World Cup last summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although at 31 he is a step or more behind the world’s elite players, he still has a deft right foot that serves him especially well on free kicks and crosses. That, coupled with his celebrity, may be enough to capture the attention of sports fans in the United States — even if some of them know his name only from “Bend It Like Beckham,” a 2002 film whose title played on his pop-icon status.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We want people around the water cooler talking about M.L.S.,” Don Garber, the league’s commissioner, said. “But David Beckham is not going to bring soccer to the next level in this country. It’s going to take a lot of things, but I hope his arrival will be an important step.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The move had been long rumored. Beckham and his wife opened a soccer academy in 2005 at the Home Depot Center in Carson, Calif., which is also the Galaxy’s home stadium. The M.L.S. board of governors voted in November to relax salary restrictions and allow each team to sign one player for any amount. The rule became widely known as the Beckham Rule.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“David Beckham wouldn’t make that kind of money in Europe,” Bill Girdner, 56, a soccer fan, said yesterday at Lucky Baldwin’s English Pub in Pasadena, Calif.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The other thing is jerseys is the way teams make a lot of money these days,” he said of the potential marketing windfall Beckham brings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beckham emerged as an international sports star in the 1990s during his tenure with Manchester United of England’s Premier League. As long as he kicked the ball into the net with that golden right foot, his fans could forgive his excesses: the outfits that ranged from sarongs to leather suits to store-ripped designer jeans and shirts open to the waist; the smirking ads for razorblades, sunglasses and perfume; the sulking and occasional histrionics; the fancy parties and A-list friends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;It&#39;s weird. I can describe the intricacies of civil war in Iraq off the top of my head. But it took me all day to consider this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, let&#39;s understand something, David Beckham, while in decline, could have stayed in Europe and had nine teams after him. Beckham, unlike Bonds or Jordan, was always regarded as a team player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Was he the best player of his time? Hell no. But he is the guy who made Man U work and brought them championships. He grew up in the ManU system and was a lifelong fan. Trading him to Real Madrid really marked the end of his club career, stuck on a team with too many stars and too much money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And maybe only Pele has been a better ambassador for the sport. He has been eager to work with kids, and his team tours put tons of money in both ManU and Real&#39;s pockets when they hit the US and Asia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oddly, what drove people nuts about him was not his lifestyle, but his bad decision making on the pitch in international games. Time and again, Beckham would lose his temper or mak a bad decision and cost England a crucial game. But despite his off-pitch lifestyle, he was no prima donna on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sure, he was the guy who defined metrosexual, but he got away with it because people knew that when it came crunch time, he was there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike the NASL, the MSL is in a far different position, with players already migrating to Europe. It didn&#39;t need Beckham to grow, but it needs Beckham to transform. And Beckham is leaving Europe when he still has some skills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beckham has long wanted to come to the US, not because he wanted the money, he has tons of endorsement deals which will go long beyond his time on the pitch, but because he can be an ambassador for soccer in the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Beckham wants to do is sell soccer to the people who play it, but drop the sport and help raise the level of the youth game. I mean, if he wanted to play in Europe, he could. But the fact is that he can make his biggest impact by moving soccer to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He cannot do this alone, but as the level of play in MSL grows, he can help it gain exposure.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116864303036734319/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116864303036734319&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116864303036734319'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116864303036734319'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/beckham-in-america.html' title='Beckham in America'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116863547392430773</id><published>2007-01-12T15:53:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-12T15:57:54.026-05:00</updated><title type='text'>When the law doesn&#39;t work, try blackmail</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/426943/guantanamo.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/675614/guantanamo.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;title&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.discourse.net/archives/2007/01/white_house_tries_economic_pressure_on_lawyers_representing_guantanamo_detainees.html&quot;&gt;White House Tries Economic Pressure on Lawyers Representing Guantanamo Detainees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m sorry, but this is just disgusting. Now that there&#39;s a real chance that the might lose in the courts, the White House is trying to put the economic screws on lawyers representing Guantanamo detainees.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This radio interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.federalnewsradio.com/emedia/59677.wma&quot;&gt;Cully Stimson, a Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense&lt;/a&gt;, heralds the start of an organized campaign by the White House to encourage major law firm clients to pressure those firms to drop their pro-bono representation of Guantanamo detainees.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Washington Post had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/11/AR2007011101698.html&quot;&gt;forceful editorial&lt;/a&gt; about this today, which says almost everything that needs saying:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;MOST AMERICANS understand that legal representation for the accused is one of the core principles of the American way. Not, it seems, Cully Stimson, deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs. In a repellent interview yesterday with Federal News Radio, Mr. Stimson brought up, unprompted, the number of major U.S. law firms that have helped represent detainees at Guantanamo Bay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Actually you know I think the news story that you&#39;re really going to start seeing in the next couple of weeks is this: As a result of a FOIA [Freedom of Information Act] request through a major news organization, somebody asked, &#39;Who are the lawyers around this country representing detainees down there,&#39; and you know what, it&#39;s shocking,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Stimson proceeded to reel off the names of these firms, adding, &quot;I think, quite honestly, when corporate CEOs see that those firms are representing the very terrorists who hit their bottom line back in 2001, those CEOs are going to make those law firms choose between representing terrorists or representing reputable firms, and I think that is going to have major play in the next few weeks. And we want to watch that play out.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asked who was paying the firms, Mr. Stimson hinted of dark doings. &quot;It&#39;s not clear, is it?&quot; he said. &quot;Some will maintain that they are doing it out of the goodness of their heart, that they&#39;re doing it pro bono, and I suspect they are; others are receiving monies from who knows where, and I&#39;d be curious to have them explain that.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It might be only laughable that Mr. Stimson, during the interview, called Guantanamo &quot;certainly, probably, the most transparent and open location in the world.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#39;s offensive -- shocking, to use his word -- that Mr. Stimson, a lawyer, would argue that law firms are doing anything other than upholding the highest ethical traditions of the bar by taking on the most unpopular of defendants. It&#39;s shocking that he would seemingly encourage the firms&#39; corporate clients to pressure them to drop this work. And it&#39;s shocking -- though perhaps not surprising -- that this is the person the administration has chosen to oversee detainee policy at Guantanamo.&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;p&gt;It&#39;s true that the list of law firms donating time to representing the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-dossari11jan11,0,4240384.story?coll=la-opinion-center&quot;&gt;victims of torture, humiliation&lt;/a&gt; (and a total lack of due process) at Guantanamo reads a bit like a who&#39;s who of the elite of the corporate bar. And they deserve credit for it.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;I&#39;d just add one thing: the first firm to cave on this issue is going to find it awfully hard to recruit elite law students, as they will have demonstrated a serious lack of moral fiber. If you won&#39;t stand up for your most desperate clients, what kind of firm are you?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;a name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;span class=&quot;posted&quot;&gt;If they can blackmail you over Gitmo, they can blackmail you over ANY client.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116863547392430773/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116863547392430773&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116863547392430773'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116863547392430773'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/when-law-doesnt-work-try-blackmail.html' title='When the law doesn&#39;t work, try blackmail'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116862637449954843</id><published>2007-01-12T13:18:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-12T13:26:14.593-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Bwaaaah</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20070112/capt.sge.hkv11.120107065150.photo00.photo.default-429x512.jpg?x=289&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=q1TGMssTRV2xpB8F4vK1PQ--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20070112/capt.sge.hkv11.120107065150.photo00.photo.default-429x512.jpg?x=289&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=q1TGMssTRV2xpB8F4vK1PQ--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;You freak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nypost.com/seven/01122007/postopinion/editorials/boxers_low_blow_editorials_.htm?page=0&quot;&gt;BOXER&#39;S LOW BLOW&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;January 12, 2007 -- Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer, an appalling scold from California, wasted no time yesterday in dragging the debate over Iraq about as low as it can go - attacking Secre tary of State Condoleezza Rice for being a childless woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Boxer was wholly in character for her party - New York&#39;s own two Democratic senators, Chuck Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, were predictably opportunistic - but the Golden State lawmaker earned special attention for the tasteless jibes she aimed at Rice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rice appeared before the Senate in defense of President Bush&#39;s tactical change in Iraq, and quickly encountered Boxer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Who pays the price? I&#39;m not going to pay a personal price,&quot; Boxer said. &quot;My kids are too old, and my grandchild is too young.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then, to Rice: &quot;You&#39;re not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, with an immediate family.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Breathtaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Simply breathtaking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We scarcely know where to begin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The junior senator from California ap parently believes that an accom plished, seasoned diplomat, a renowned scholar and an adviser to two presidents like Condoleezza Rice is not fully qualified to make policy at the highest levels of the American government because she is a single, childless woman. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same could be said for many people in government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the fact is the Post wasn&#39;t outraged when Laura Bush said essentially the same thing. No more Ms. Nice Guy. Rice is saying more kids should die, and she doesn&#39;t even have a dog. People have stopped being polite.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that Rice, as far as we know, has no lovers, close relatives or even social life.

Bush seeking to plunge the country deeper into the Iraq quagmire, Webb introduced the &lt;i&gt;Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007&lt;/i&gt;, legislation that will provide the newest Veterans with educational benefits like those received by men and women who served in the three decades following World War II.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;As a veteran who hails from a family with a long history of military service, I am proud to offer this bill as my first piece of legislation in the United States Senate,&quot; said Webb, in introducing his bill last week. &quot;The G.I. bill program was designed to help veterans readjust to civilian life, avoid high levels of unemployment, and give veterans the opportunity to receive the education and training that they missed while bravely serving in the military.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Webb, a former Secretary of the Navy and a highly-decorated Vietnam Veteran, introduced his legislation to provide enhanced benefits to those serving in the military since September 11, 2001. It will replace the Montgomery G.I. Bill, to which military personnel must contribute -- while earning a low active-duty salary anyway -- and which only provides financial support of up to $800 per month for educational expenses, which may not cover the cost of a full college education.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;i&gt;Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act&lt;/i&gt; will pay for Veterans&#39; tuition, books, fees, and other training costs, while also providing a monthly stipend of $1,000 for living expenses, thus making it much more possible for a large number of Veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan to actually be able to complete a college education and build a better life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The United States has never erred when it has made sustained new investments in higher education and job training,&quot; said Webb. &quot;Enacting the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 is not only the right thing to do for our men and women in uniform, but it also is a strong tonic for an economy plagued by growing disparities in wealth, stagnant wages, and the outsourcing of American jobs.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Webb also pointed out that Veterans have enough adjustments to make upon returning to civilian society and those who went into the military in part to get a college education and better their lot in life, deserve the country&#39;s support in realizing educational opportunity without additional hardship.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Better-educated veterans have a more positive readjustment experience,&quot; said Webb, who earned a Navy Cross, Silver Star, two Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts for his Vietnam service. &quot;This experience lowers the costs of treating post-traumatic stress disorder and other readjustment-related difficulties.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saying that the limited Montgomery G.I. Bill is &quot;simply insufficient after 9/11,&quot; Webb made the case that the extreme adversity, sacrifice and risk endured by those serving in today&#39;s military makes providing greater Veterans benefits a matter of fairness and national honor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Now our nation is fighting a worldwide war against terrorism. Since 9/11, we have witnessed a sharp increase in the demands placed upon our military,&quot; said Webb. &quot;Many of our military members are serving two or three tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. In light of these immense hardships, it is now time to implement a more robust educational assistance program for our heroic veterans who have sacrificed so much for our great Nation.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within the text of Webb&#39;s legislation it says that &quot;the people of the United States greatly value military service and recognize the difficult challenges involved in readjusting to civilian life after wartime service in the Armed Forces.&quot; Quick passage of this legislation will show that a Democratic Congress truly &lt;i&gt;does&lt;/i&gt; value the troops and that the Commonwealth of Virginia -- which is home to a large number of Veterans -- was wise to elect Webb to replace Allen, who did nothing like this while a member of the do-nothing GOP Congress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And Webb&#39;s going to be there to keep reminding people that patriotism involves supporting the troops in deeds, as well as with words and magnetic ribbons on cars.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I am a proud Veteran who is honored to serve this great nation,&quot; said Webb on his first day as a United States Senator. &quot;As long as I represent Virginians in the United States Senate, I will make it a priority to help protect our brave men and women in uniform.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;b&gt;* * * * *&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;b&gt;A Personal Postscript&lt;/b&gt;: I had a difficult time adjusting when I was discharged from the military and, while I had to work most of the time I spent at San Francisco State University, I was fortunate to be able to attend five years of college on the old G.I. Bill that Webb&#39;s legislation will restore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having the ability to quickly and easily go from the U.S. Navy straight into being a normal college student, enabled everything I have achieved since. I can also tell you that, being the only person in my family to ever get a college degree, the U.S. government has been paid back many times over in the salary I have been able to earn in my career and the corresponding taxes I have paid -- compared to what I would have contributed to the U.S. Treasury as a manual laborer back home in rural Nebraska.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A robust G.I. Bill set the tone for my adult life and Webb&#39;s bill will pave the way for a new generation of Veterans to get the same kick-start to a healthy post-military life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;The GI Bill changed who ran America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before WWII, going to college was a matter of luck or money. For most people it was impossible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How diverse were the changes? Bob Dole went to law school. George Plimpton founded the Paris Review. Charles Rangel, John Conyers and David Obey are among the beneficiaries of the GI currently serving in Congress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The current, meager GI Bill does little to help veterans become productive members of society. The old GI Bill allowed for class mobility unlike we have ever seen.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116861604969777517/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116861604969777517&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116861604969777517'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116861604969777517'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/real-gi-bill.html' title='A real GI Bill'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://i39.photobucket.com/albums/e164/bobgeiger/Senators/th_webb.gif" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116858575809717382</id><published>2007-01-12T02:27:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-12T02:09:18.130-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Bush will lose the country</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/502760/bushside.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/29148/bushside.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I haven&#39;t really had much to say about Bush, lately, reposting the thoughts of others. Because to be honest, I&#39;ve said this from 2003 and seeing it play out like some horrible dream is no shock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the threats about Iran have been on DK for six months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I think Wednesday&#39;s speech scared the shit out of a lot of people. If he had left Iran out of it, well, it would have just sucked. But that extra bit of neocon wingnuttery, attack Iran for no clear reason? Well, that made a few people shit their pants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What our foul, corrupt punditocracy misses is that Bush is losing the people who went along. He may keep 25 percent, but as this goes on, and Odierno and Petraeus recreate the DeLattre Line in Baghdad, and the casualities mount, the people who vote against escalation today, will be voting for impeachment tomorrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush refuses to listen or alter his plans, even when they fail. Trying to scare Iran after they&#39;ve had four years to plan how to fuck US troops over with as few fingerprints as possible is just stupid. What if Sistani just says fuck it and calls for a jihad against the US? That is a card he does not want to play, but he isn&#39;t going to let Bush bomb Qom either. Bush and his team are simpletons. Sistani will protect Shia Islam, at any price.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not like they can send a 500lb bomb through his door.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Too many people think we control events in Iraq. I want to smack Odierno when he says it will take years. I wanted to punch some idiot babling about moving US troops to Kurdistan? As if the Turks will allow them to resupply. We control nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush is in this mess because Rove has always acted as if they were the majority. Now that they are not, Rice sounds like a simpleton. Hagel was PISSED today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years ago, Larry Eagleburger said, long time GOP factorum Eagleburger said, if Bush moves on Iran, it will be time for impeachment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When you look at the plan itself, it&#39;s fucking insane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea of housing US and Iraqi troops in the same buildings may seem like a good idea, until the frags start flying and the Mahdi Army makes their 3 AM attack. If you&#39;re lucky, the frags won&#39;t be coming from inside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;27 strongpoints for guerrillas to mortar every night.  Jesus. I think if the day comes when Sistani or even Sadr says it&#39;s on, a lot of Americans are gonna die in their own bases.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, in the end, I think America has had enough. Sending the Guard back is an insane political mistake. Two tours for part-time solders?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ABC&#39;s Erin Hayes is an especially stupid woman. She interviews soldiers wives and gets vague answers. Duh. Their husband&#39;s careers would be ruined if they told the truth. God, interview some anonymously and see what they say. This is destroying families. They know people getting divorces, the fucked up discharges. And they will never tell you the truth unless you protect them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, I think Bush will lose the country, and eventually leave in disgrace because his plan will fail. It will fail badly and bloodily and he will be exposed as the weak little man he is and we will not have long to wait.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116858575809717382/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116858575809717382&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858575809717382'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858575809717382'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/bush-will-lose-country.html' title='Bush will lose the country'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116858564882892772</id><published>2007-01-12T02:03:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-12T02:07:28.866-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Pointless</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/915521/jumpiraqis.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/953261/jumpiraqis.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Who are their bosses?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/11/AR2007011102219_pf.html&quot;&gt;U.S. Unit Patrolling Baghdad Sees Flaws in Bush Strategy&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Sudarsan Raghavan&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Foreign Service&lt;br /&gt;Friday, January 12, 2007; A01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The day after his speech, the soldiers of Apache Company went on a mission to the volatile neighborhood of Hurriyah that underscored the challenges confronting U.S. troops as they attempt to clear neighborhoods of sectarian fighters and keep them that way under Iraqi control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Across Baghdad, Iraq&#39;s mostly Shiite security forces have proved unable to keep neighborhoods secure on their own. Sunni Arabs deeply mistrust the army and police, viewing them as a sectarian weapon of the Shiite-led government. Iraqi army commanders say their soldiers lack training and equipment, while some U.S. officials worry that Iraq&#39;s troops are too dependent on their American counterparts and will become even more so with the expected surge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Stryker rolled through the mud of Camp Liberty and made its way to Hurriyah, a mostly Shiite area nestled west of the Tigris River. Apache Company&#39;s mission: to search a few houses for weapons caches based on intelligence reports. Caldwell and his soldiers worried about the intelligence they had been given. It had come from an Iraqi army -- or &quot;IA,&quot; in U.S. soldier lingo -- officer a week ago. They wondered whether they were being set up for an ambush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a joke,&quot; said Pfc. Drew Merrell, 22, of Jefferson City, Mo., shaking his head and flashing a smile as the Stryker rolled through Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;They feed us what they want,&quot; said Spec. Josh Lake, 26, of Ventura, Calif., referring to the intelligence. &quot;I guarantee that everyone in the city knows where we&#39;re going. Because the IA told them. The only thing they don&#39;t know is how big a force we&#39;re coming with.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this morning, 22 U.S. soldiers were in the Stryker convoy along with one Iraqi interpreter, whom the soldiers called Joey. He didn&#39;t want his real name used for security reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Pretty soon the Shiites will be tired of our presence, just like the Sunnis,&quot; said Lake, noting that the squad now makes almost daily trips to Hurriyah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The general feeling among us is we&#39;re not really doing anything here,&quot; Caldwell said. &quot;We clear one neighborhood, then another one fires up. It&#39;s an ongoing battle. It never ends.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We&#39;re constantly being told that it&#39;s not our fight. It is their fight,&quot; said Sgt. Jose Reynoso, 24, of Yuma, Ariz., speaking of the Iraqi army. &quot;But that&#39;s not the case. Whenever we go and ask them for guys, they almost always say no, and we have to do the job ourselves.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;You do have corruption problems among the ranks,&quot; said Sgt. Justin Hill, 24, of Abilene Tex., the squad leader. &quot;I don&#39;t know what they can do about that. They have militias inside them. They are pretty much everywhere.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The intel they give us and the intel we get are two different things,&quot; Lake said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Caldwell, as he listened to the conversation, leaned his head back and said:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I want to go back and play my PlayStation.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116858564882892772/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116858564882892772&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858564882892772'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858564882892772'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/pointless_12.html' title='Pointless'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116858290073215530</id><published>2007-01-12T01:18:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-12T01:21:40.750-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Bush&#39;s fantasyland</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/286984/unicorn.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/710678/unicorn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Yes, yes, we will make Iraq a democracy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.juancole.com/2007/01/bush-sends-gis-to-his-private.html&quot;&gt; Bush Sends GIs to his Private Fantasyland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;To listen to Bush&#39;s speech on Wednesday, you would imagine that al-Qaeda has occupied large swathes of Iraq with the help of Syria and Iran and is brandishing missiles at the US mainland. That the president of the United States can come out after nearly four years of such lies and try to put this fantasy over on the American people is shameful.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The answer to &quot;al-Qaeda&#39;s&quot; occupation of neighborhoods in Baghdad and the cities of al-Anbar is then, Bush says, to send in more US troops to &quot;clear and hold&quot; these neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But is that really the big problem in Iraq? Bush is thinking in terms of a conventional war, where armies fight to hold territory. But if a nimble guerrilla group can come out at night and set off a bomb at the base of a large tenement building in a Shiite neighborhood, they can keep the sectarian civil war going. They work by provoking reprisals. They like to hold territory if they can. But as we saw with Fallujah and Tal Afar, if they cannot they just scatter and blow things up elsewhere.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the main problem is not &quot;al-Qaeda,&quot; which is small and probably not that important, and anyway is not really Bin Laden&#39;s al-Qaeda. They are just Salafi jihadis who appropriated the name. When their leader, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed, it didn&#39;t cause the insurgency to miss a beat. Conclusion: &quot;al-Qaeda&quot; is not central to the struggle. Izzat Ibrahim Duri and the Baath Party are probably the center of gravity of the resistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush admitted that the Sunni guerrilla destruction of the Askariyah (Golden Dome) shrine at Samarra set off an orgy of sectarian reprisals. But he does not seem to have actually absorbed the lesson here. The guerrillas did not have to hold territory in order to carry out that bombing. They just had to be able to sneak into a poorly guarded old building that Bush did not even know about and blow it up. The symbolic and psychic damage that they did to the Shiites was profound. Blowing up hundreds of worshippers on Ashura had not had nearly this impact, since the damaged shrine was dedicated to the hidden Twelfth Imam or Mahdi, the Shiite promised one. Many religious Shiites in Iraq are now millenarians, desperately waiting for the Promised One to reveal himself and restore the world to justice. The guerrillas hit the symbol of that hope.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are other such targets. The Shrine of Imam Kadhim at Kadhimiya, the shrine of Ali in Najaf, and the shrine of Husayn in Karbala, and the person of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani himself, also the person of Hujjat al-Islam Muqtada al-Sadr. (The arrogance and ignorance of the US chattering classes is such that they openly talk about &quot;taking out&quot; al-Sadr, as though that would calm the Iraqi Shiites down. Saddam thought like that when he offed Muqtada&#39;s father; didn&#39;t work.) The US and British military nevertheless seem set to attack the Mahdi Army. Investments in guarding those sites (the most exposed of which is Kahdimiya) would be worth far more than temporarily intimidating angry Sunnis who have picked up a gun in the Dura neighborhood of Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush could not help taking swipes at Iran and Syria. But the geography of his deployments gives the lie to his singling them out as mischief makers. Why send 4,000 extra troops to al-Anbar province? Why ignore Diyala Province near Iran, which is in flames, or Babel Province southwest of Baghdad? Diyala borders Iran, so isn&#39;t that the threat? But wait. Where is al-Anbar? Between Jordan and Baghdad. In other words, al-Anbar opens out into the vast Sunni Arab hinterland that supports the guerrilla movement with money and volunteers, coming in from Jordan. If Syria was the big problem, you would put the extra 4,000 troops up north along the border. If Iran was the big problem, you&#39;d occupy Diyala. But little Jordan is an ally of the US, and Bush would not want to insult it by admitting that it is a major infiltration root for jihadis heading to Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The clear and hold strategy is not going to work in al-Anbar. Almost everyone there hates the Americans and wants them out. To clear and hold you need a sympathetic or potentially sympathetic civilian population that is being held hostage by militants, and which you can turn by offering them protection from the militants. I don&#39;t believe there are very many Iraqi Sunnis who can any longer be turned in that way. The opinion polling suggests that they overwhelmingly support violence against the US.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This strategy may have some successes here and there. It won&#39;t win the day, and I&#39;d be surprised if it did not collapse by the end of the summer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If part of the strategy is to assault the Mahdi Army frontally, that will cause enormous trouble in the Shiite south. I would suggest that PM Nuri al-Maliki&#39;s warning to the Mahdi Militia to disarm or face the US military is in fact code. He is telling the Sadrists to lie low while the US mops up the Sunni Arab guerrillas. Sadr&#39;s militia became relatively quiescent for a whole year after the Marines defeated it at Najaf in August, 2004. But since it is rooted in an enormous social movement, the militia is fairly easy to reconstitute after it goes into hiding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116858290073215530/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116858290073215530&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858290073215530'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858290073215530'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/bushs-fantasyland_12.html' title='Bush&#39;s fantasyland'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116858260912534651</id><published>2007-01-12T01:13:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-12T01:16:49.153-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Better to  drop FAE&#39;s instead</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20070111/capt.sa10401112336.playboy_military_sa104.jpg?x=238&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=4qgSMcC37y3ubDgqjwTcNg--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 250px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20070111/capt.sa10401112336.playboy_military_sa104.jpg?x=238&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=4qgSMcC37y3ubDgqjwTcNg--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;(AP Photo/Eric Gay)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;                   U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt.

But that battle does not tell the whole story of a curious December.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over all, the industry sold $3.7 billion of hardware, software and accessories in the United States last month, up from $2.9 billion in the same period a year ago. For the full year, sales were $12.5 billion, the industry’s highest-ever returns, according to widely watched figures released Thursday by NPD Group, a market research firm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During December, Sony in particular turned in surprisingly strong sales — but not for its new PlayStation 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a development that industry analysts said speaks to the strength of the video-game market and the lure of low prices, the nation’s best-selling console during the holiday season was Sony’s PlayStation 2, a six-year-old system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Americans bought 1.4 million PlayStation 2s during the period. That was more than the Xbox 360, which sold 1.1 million units; the Nintendo Wii, which sold 604,000; and the PlayStation 3, which sold 491,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sales figures for the PlayStation 3, and in particular the Wii, fell below the expectations of industry analysts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The biggest surprise is the Wii,” said Mike Hickey, a research analyst with Janco Partners. He said analysts had projected Nintendo would sell around 1.2 million, twice what they wound up selling. Mr. Hickey and other analysts had estimated Sony would sell 500,000 to 600,000 PlayStation 3s and Microsoft would sell 1.1 million to 1.3 million 360s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for Sony and Nintendo, the trouble was not demand but supply, Mr. Janco said. “It probably means that Nintendo missed its goal” of shipping four million Wiis worldwide by the end of the year, he said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116858176980231231/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116858176980231231&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858176980231231'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858176980231231'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/duh.html' title='Duh'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116858153125728201</id><published>2007-01-12T00:53:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-12T00:58:51.316-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Talk or no talk</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/814217/bell%20march.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/46911/bell%20march.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/nyregion/12shot.html?_r=1&amp;amp;oref=slogin&quot;&gt;For Police Involved in Fatal Shooting, Talking May Be Risky&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By AL BAKER&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 12, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The decision by four of the five police officers involved in the killing of an unarmed Queens man to voluntarily speak to prosecutors, giving investigators their version of events for the first time, poses certain risks for both sides, lawyers and legal experts say.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By voluntarily talking with prosecutors, officers can often try to gain points as well as offer insights into their state of mind during a shooting, the experts said. The biggest risk to a police officer, however, is that once he tells a story, he is married to it and can only change it later at his peril. Prosecutors can attack any inconsistencies during subsequent grand jury proceedings or at trial, some defense lawyers and former prosecutors said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While prosecutors face few pitfalls in questioning officers in such cases — either before a grand jury proceeding, during it, or at both times — they risk criticism doing it beforehand because of the potential for cozy dealings between prosecutors and the police, legal analysts said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Hardy, a lawyer for the family of Sean Bell, the Queens man who was killed, said yesterday that he was concerned by the officers parading in, one after another, to tell their stories to prosecutors in the office of the Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown. Mr. Bell died in a hail of 50 police bullets on Nov. 25, just hours before he was to be married.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“What does concern me is to the extent that such meetings would have some undue influence on the prosecutors and how they present it to the grand jury,” Mr. Hardy said. “It has the appearance of impropriety only because of the general suspicion that exists within the general public about the closeness of the relationship between the district attorney and the police. And that is why it boils down to whether or not there is real integrity to the investigation, because it really will depend on how they use the information the officers give and how aggressively they use it in the grand jury.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who represent the Bell family as well as the two men who were wounded in the shooting have also expressed outrage over what they see as a basic weakness in the criminal justice system: that district attorneys investigate cases of excessive use of force by the police, with whom they must work every day&lt;/blockquote&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116858153125728201/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116858153125728201&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858153125728201'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116858153125728201'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/talk-or-no-talk.html' title='Talk or no talk'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116853386545774691</id><published>2007-01-11T11:40:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-11T11:44:25.490-05:00</updated><title type='text'>How stupid can you be</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/Congdon%20gets%20tasered-thumb.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/Congdon%20gets%20tasered-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;on&quot; style=&quot;display: block;&quot; id=&quot;formatbar_CreateLink&quot; title=&quot;Link&quot; onmouseover=&quot;ButtonHoverOn(this);&quot; onmouseout=&quot;ButtonHoverOff(this);&quot; onmouseup=&quot;&quot; onmousedown=&quot;CheckFormatting(event);FormatbarButton(&#39;richeditorframe&#39;, this, 8);ButtonMouseDown(this);&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;img/gl.link.gif&quot; alt=&quot;Link&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2 class=&quot;etp_permalink&quot;&gt;    &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eat-the-press/2007/01/10/a-psa-from-etp-tasers-ar_e_38336.html&quot;&gt;A PSA From ETP: Tasers Are Not Toys&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/h2&gt;    &lt;p class=&quot;newsmeta etp_permalink_newsmeta&quot;&gt;    Rachel Sklar |         Posted Wednesday January 10, 2007 at 08:12 PM   &lt;/p&gt;     &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;We &lt;a href=&quot;http://gawker.com/news/awesome-taserings/amanda-congdon-the-ultimate-in-taser-porn-227802.php&quot;&gt;read with horror&lt;/a&gt; of the &quot;Try The Taser!&quot; booth at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where random people can test out what it would feel like to be tasered. The company is marketing a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taser.com/ctwo/index.htm&quot;&gt;consumer version&lt;/a&gt; (in four stylish colors, including metallic pink!), because loosing a bunch of trigger-happy taserists on the world couldn&#39;t possibly go wrong. From the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taser.com/ctwo/index.htm&quot;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;:  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The TASER C2 can stop a threat up to 15 feet away, allowing you to protect yourself and your family from a safe distance.

In assessing manning needs for Iraq, one would do well to look to prior conflicts of similar nature… one might look especially to the Boer War, in which a fractious, semi-fanatical culture was slowly ground into submission by an occupying force — several years after the seeming success of the initial invasion. If it sounds familiar, it should: and so the means of victory there offer an instructive thought experiment for Iraq today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make no mistake: those means were cruel. I have stated previously that I endorse cruel things in war — to eschew them is folly. &lt;i&gt;The British achieved victory over the Boers by taking their women and children away to concentration camps, by laying waste to the countryside, and by dotting the veld with small garrisons in blockhouses at regular intervals&lt;/i&gt;. The men who remained were hindered in their movements by the wire stretching from blockhouse to blockhouse (a phenomenon that the Morice Line experience has shown would be massively more effective now); they could either surrender or die. Absent women and children, the rules of engagement were lax. From implementation to victory took under 18 months. To accomplish this required over one-quarter million soldiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;[My emphasis; batshit Nazified desires from the heart of darkness in original.] &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And just think, if he wasn’t too crazy for the Army as well as a shitbird boy, he could spearhead the stormtrooper job with his cool lightsaber!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://sadlyno.com/wordpress/uploads/2007/01/tacitus.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Anyway, great, Tacky: With your latest suggestion, you’ve just equalled &lt;a href=&quot;http://sadlyno.com/archives/3032.html&quot;&gt;Adam “Put them in human-sized  microwaves” Yoshida&lt;/a&gt; in the great ‘Flagrant Displays of Psychopathy’ contest so many wingnuts have entered.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Bradrocket adds&lt;/strong&gt;: Hey, but at least he doesn’t use filthy language.

Moqtada Sadr hung Saddam Hussein. Not the government, and they had to go along.  So any threat from Maliki should be taken as a threat from Kerensky to tell Lenin that Trotsky needs to control the Bolsheviks&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Sadr has already manuvered his way past Washington&#39;s coup and had brutally demonstrated his power&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) There is no effective Iraqi government to impliment any program.  No matter how much money you give to them, they will either steal it or not use it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4) While Maliki talks unity government, his plan for securing Baghdad basically means attacking  Sunni neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5) Sadr fully expects a surge. Fully. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6768704&quot;&gt;According to NPR&lt;/a&gt;, he&#39;s handing out grenades to every home and drafting every swinging dick between 15 and 45.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People think Bush can flatten Sadr City with airstrikes like they did Fallujah, but that is impossible. People fled Fallujah and turned it into a battleground. So you had minimal risks of killing whole blocks of people.  The US could also surround Fallujah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadr City is a whole different story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadr can not only tie down US forces in Sadr City, his supporters and their criminal allies can cut the supply lines to Baghdad.  US air power is extremely limited and could be counter productive. The people of Sadr City have no place to go. They will defend their homes. If you turn some of them into rubble, you repeat the mistake the Israelis made last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The constant talk of the Iraqi Army joining in this may be the winter&#39;s most brutal surprise. If they don&#39;t defect, they may not show up.  This is a plan of bailing wire and duct tape.  Bush gave a speech which should have scared the crap out of people, and I think did. The pundits, unarmed, treat this plan seriously, and mention increased casualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they aren&#39;t telling you is that if the US gets sucked into urban combat with both the Shia and Sunni, we will have a disaster on our hands.  Not only more dead and wounded, but US forces hampered by the supply line attacks and the desertion of the Iraqi Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Odierno and Petraeus take the Iraqis at their word. They are fools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We will not get the Iraqi support promised. And Americans will die because of that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116849331476766843/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116849331476766843&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116849331476766843'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116849331476766843'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/reality-check.html' title='Reality Check'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116850226336865148</id><published>2007-01-11T03:00:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-11T02:57:43.420-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Madness in action</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://us.news3.yimg.com/ca.yimg.com/p/061226/afp/isgedjw39261206140313photo02.jpg?x=248&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=F_N3N_sNAMXHlMuKzvIgAg--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://us.news3.yimg.com/ca.yimg.com/p/061226/afp/isgedjw39261206140313photo02.jpg?x=248&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=F_N3N_sNAMXHlMuKzvIgAg--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Ahmad al-Rubaye/AFP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/10/AR2007011002581.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Intensified Combat on Streets Likely&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Thomas E. Ricks and Ann Scott Tyson&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Staff Writers&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, January 11, 2007; Page A01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;President Bush&#39;s plan to send tens of thousands of U.S. and Iraqi reinforcements to Baghdad to jointly confront Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias is likely to touch off a more dangerous phase of the war, featuring months of fighting in the streets of the Iraqi capital, current and former military officials warned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The terrorists and insurgents in Iraq are without conscience, and they will make the year ahead bloody and violent,&quot; the president said last night in explaining his revised approach. &quot;Even if our new strategy works exactly as planned, deadly acts of violence will continue -- and we must expect more Iraqi and American casualties.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The prospect of a more intense battle in the Iraqi capital could put U.S. military commanders in exactly the sort of tough urban fight that war planners strove to avoid during the spring 2003 invasion of the country. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The plan to partner U.S. and Iraqi units may compel American soldiers to rely on questionable Iraqi army and police forces as never before.&lt;/span&gt; And while the president insisted there is no timetable associated with the troop increase, military officials said sustaining it for more than a few months would place a major new strain on U.S. forces that already are feeling burdened by an unexpectedly long and difficult war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of all, the White House&#39;s insistence on confronting all insurgents and militias, both Sunni and Shiite, may mean that the U.S. military will wind up fighting the Mahdi Army of radical cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;That militia is estimated by some U.S. intelligence officials to have grown over the past year to about 60,000 fighters, and some in the Pentagon consider it more militarily effective than the Iraqi army.&lt;/span&gt; Fighting it could resemble on a citywide scale the sharp combat that took place this week along central Baghdad&#39;s Haifa Street, in which U.S. jets and attack helicopters conducted airstrikes just north of the U.S. Embassy in the protected Green Zone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;There will be more violence than usual because of the surge, and a surge with more casualties plays up on the international stage,&quot; said a senior Army official. Sadr &quot;is going to have to make a choice, and if he decides on a confrontation, it will be pretty significant,&quot; added a senior Pentagon official.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadr is one of the most powerful figures in the Iraqi government, and he has forced it and the U.S. military to back down in the past. Yet if the Mahdi Army is not confronted, the entire offensive may falter and the sectarian conflict may intensify, because Sunnis will feel it is just one more way of attacking them while letting Shiite death squads go free, military experts said. &quot;If our troops do not enter Sadr City, they belittle the notion of a surge because they would leave a leading militia unscathed,&quot; said Patrick Cronin of the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a defense think tank.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The last time the U.S. military fought both Sunni and Shiite elements in Iraq was the spring of 2004, which became one of the most difficult times in the war. U.S. commanders were stunned to face a two-front conflict against Sunni insurgents in Anbar province and Shiites in Baghdad and across a broad swath of south-central Iraq. Troops from the Army&#39;s 1st Cavalry Division fighting in Sadr&#39;s stronghold of about 2 million Shiites in eastern Baghdad became enmeshed in a series of clashes resembling the movie &quot;Black Hawk Down.&quot; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sadr&#39;s militias besieged isolated U.S. patrols and took over police stations, schools and municipal buildings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An Army officer who recently commanded a battalion in Baghdad predicted last night that the plan would fail because Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and his government &quot;will do things to maintain protection&quot; of Sadr&#39;s forces. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;He also dismissed as &quot;happy talk&quot; the president&#39;s notion that the predominantly Shiite Iraqi army and police could reassure pro-insurgent Sunni neighborhoods by conducting foot patrols through them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush said it is now clear that there have not been sufficient troops in Baghdad, and that part of the difference in this approach is that the plan will be adequately resourced. Yet the total number of U.S. troops in Iraq after the planned increase will be about 153,000, less than the peak of about 165,000 in December 2005. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Military experts last night wondered, as one said, how a &quot;thin green line&quot; of 17,500 additional soldiers in Baghdad could affect the security situation in a city where many of the 5 million residents are hostile to the U.S. presence.&lt;/span&gt; &quot;Too little, too late -- way too late,&quot; said retired Col. Jerry Durrant, who has worked as a trainer of Iraqi forces.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So Bush expects to win the American people over as casualities increase?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116850226336865148/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116850226336865148&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116850226336865148'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116850226336865148'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/madness-in-action.html' title='Madness in action'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116850115861204215</id><published>2007-01-11T02:35:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-11T02:39:18.643-05:00</updated><title type='text'>They don&#39;t want us</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20070111/capt.sge.haw97.110107065631.photo00.photo.default-512x363.jpg?x=380&amp;y=269&amp;amp;sig=.CfIAtXhW4RjEkUiqW2yEg--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/afp/20070111/capt.sge.haw97.110107065631.photo00.photo.default-512x363.jpg?x=380&amp;y=269&amp;amp;sig=.CfIAtXhW4RjEkUiqW2yEg--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;(AFP/Brendan Smialowski&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/11/world/middleeast/11iraq.html&quot;&gt;Promising Troops Where They Aren’t Really Wanted&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By SABRINA TAVERNISE and JOHN F. BURNS&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 11, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan. 10 — As President Bush challenges public opinion at home by committing more American troops, he is confronted by a paradox: an Iraqi government that does not really want them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shiite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki has not publicly opposed the American troop increase, but aides to Mr. Maliki have been saying for weeks that the government is wary of the proposal. They fear that an increased American troop presence, particularly in Baghdad, will be accompanied by a more assertive American role that will conflict with the Shiite government’s haste to cut back on American authority and run the war the way it wants. American troops, Shiite leaders say, should stay out of Shiite neighborhoods and focus on fighting Sunni insurgents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The government believes there is no need for extra troops from the American side,” Haidar al-Abadi, a Parliament member and close associate of Mr. Maliki, said Wednesday. “The existing troops can do the job.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is an opinion that is broadly held among a Shiite political elite that is increasingly impatient, after nearly two years heading the government here, to exercise power without the constraining supervision of the United States. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;As a long-oppressed majority, the Shiites have a deep-seated fear that the power they won at the polls, after centuries of subjugation by the Sunni minority, will be progressively whittled away as the Americans seek deals with the Sunnis that will help bring American troops home.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attack Sadr? Yeah, that will happen with Iraqi troops.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116850115861204215/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116850115861204215&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116850115861204215'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116850115861204215'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/they-dont-want-us.html' title='They don&#39;t want us'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116848038439784112</id><published>2007-01-10T20:49:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-10T20:53:04.430-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Something to look at while Bush speaks</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/268139/baghdadethno1-738784.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/332335/baghdadethno1-738784.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is what Bush wants the US Army to control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click on the map to see the size of the problem he thinks 20,000 men can contain</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116848038439784112/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116848038439784112&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116848038439784112'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116848038439784112'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/something-to-look-at-while-bush-speaks.html' title='Something to look at while Bush speaks'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116847618652422217</id><published>2007-01-10T19:40:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-10T19:43:06.560-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Spoke.com sells addresses</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070111/2007_01_10t182513_450x436_us_cisco_iphone.jpg?x=356&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=9Z6rB5jNOnMQyd6V9u7HYA--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070111/2007_01_10t182513_450x436_us_cisco_iphone.jpg?x=356&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=9Z6rB5jNOnMQyd6V9u7HYA--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Jobs, we got your number from Spoke.Com&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;032201&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:/http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/10/spokecom_is_selling_.html/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:/http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/10/spokecom_is_selling_.html/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Spoke.com is selling your friends&#39; Outlook address books&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Phil sez, &quot;Spoke.com has sucked 3 million records (in 6 months) out of the Outlook address books of your friends and is selling them on their website.&quot; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;032201&quot;&gt;Spoke says that it launched it&#39;s free service in August and that they have added 3 million new names since August. How did they do that? It was easy! To get access to Spoke&#39;s &quot;free&quot; service, you must install the Spoke toolbar. The Spoke toolbar then copies all of the information from your address book into the Spoke database. It&#39;s at this point you should be able to smell the burning sulfur. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;a name=&quot;032201&quot;&gt;If, for example, I pressed the button for Spoke&#39;s free service, the Spoke toolbar would install and then copy the roughly 2100 names, phone numbers, and email addresses out of my Outlook Contact database and then add them to Spoke&#39;s database. Spoke would then be able to sell those names, titles, companies, addresses, and email addresses to direct marketing organizations. Participating in this scheme is a sure path to hell. &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  &lt;a name=&quot;032201&quot;&gt;They&#39;ve got unlisted numbers, private addresses, cell-phone numbers and so forth.

There&amp;#39;s a fire in their eyes—a fearless passion to\nbecome U.S. soldiers&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;They inspire me,&amp;quot; Forenczek added.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;New Marine Sierra Pettingill, a 22-year-old sociology major who left\nDuke University before her final semester, said she felt compelled to\nserve after realizing she did not have a single acquaintance who had\ndied, or even served, in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was sending out invitations to my champagne-brunch birthday\nget-together when I heard that U.S. military casualties in Iraq had\nreached 2,900,&amp;quot; Pettingill said. &amp;quot;I decided then and there that I would\nnot allow this inherently unequal system to perpetuate any longer, no\nmatter how much I want to go have martini night at the Oak Room.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Though most of the privileged enlistee youths said they were\nmotivated by a newfound concern that America&amp;#39;s reputation could be\npermanently damaged with a loss in Iraq, others have cited the examples\nset by their relatives as instrumental in their decision to join.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My great-great-great-great grandfather would not have been able to\nmake a fortune in the fur trade and real-estate business had it not\nbeen for the brave people who fought in the Revolutionary War,&amp;quot; said\n24-year-old John Jacob Astor VIII, who has put all of his business\nventures on hold indefinitely. &amp;quot;My children are going to know the\nimportance of stepping up to the plate when their nation needs them.&amp;quot; &quot;,1] );  //--&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;They don&#39;t have these recruitment centers where I live,&quot; said Daniel Feldman, 26, who resides in the affluent neighborhood of Brookline, MA and recently passed his bar exam. &quot;I didn&#39;t realize you could just sign up, but now that I do, all of my friends from law school, yoga class, and temple are going to join, too.

Even in WWII, Americans did horrible things like kill unarmed prisoners and desecrate the dead. Americans. Before we unleash war, we need to be sure that there are no other choices. Instead, you sit there with your cheetos stained hands and cheerlead death without reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You think these forces can control a city of 5-7 million people? Are you silly?

By consequences, I don&#39;t mean anything as concrete as the prospects of a possible Al Qaeda sanctuary in Anbar provence or the abandonment of thousands of Iraqis to certain death. I&#39;m talking about something more nebulous: what are the consequences of America losing a war--which is, after all, what withdrawal will mean? What will it do to our position in the world? What will it do to the national psyche? And what will it do to the people who fought in that war? (Yes, they&#39;ll be out of harm&#39;s way, but they&#39;ll also be left to conclude that all their efforts--and their sacrifices--were in vain.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Granted, these are all things Bush and supporters of the war should have thought more about before we invaded Iraq; but now that we&#39;re there--and we&#39;re all so sick of this war that many of us want to get out--we can&#39;t afford to ignore them again. The question about the surge to me is: are the consequences of defeat so dire that it&#39;s worth one final attempt to avoid it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know the answer to that. I&#39;ll watch Bush&#39;s speech tomorrow night; I&#39;ll listen to what Kennedy and Biden and any other Democrats have to say in response; and I&#39;ll try to come to a conclusion. Maybe that&#39;s not a position of &quot;moral seriousness.&quot; But I can&#39;t help but thinking that it was certainty--on the part of supporters of the war--that got us into this mess. And I&#39;d hate for such certainty--on the part of opponents of the war (some of whom were actually certain in their support of the war not that long ago)--to get us into another one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--Jason Zengerle &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For some reason, Frank Foer cowers in fear from Spencer Ackerman, yet allows Zengerle to put this crap in his magazine. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know he&#39;s confused about journalistic ethics, but let me explain about &quot;moral seriousness&quot;.

Joseph Lieberman agreed yesterday that risk is the top factor in beefing up homeland security - but still wouldn&#39;t fix a formula that stiffs New York City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That was after Bloomberg testified before Lieberman&#39;s Homeland Security Committee in hopes of persuading the Connecticut independent to kill a formula that guarantees each state a minimum share of anti-terror funding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Time and time again, our calls for fully risk-based homeland security funding have been ignored,&quot; Bloomberg said. &quot;Instead, we have seen huge sums of homeland security money spread across the country like peanut butter.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieberman agreed New York is full of targets, but still contended small states like his need to guard against terrorists and deserve their peanut butter. &quot;Everybody and everything is at risk in America,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By his definition, homeland security funding already is handed out mostly based on risk. But he said fighting over how the money is divided isn&#39;t the answer; instead, the government should give out more cash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It&#39;s unbelievable and outrageous that homeland security grant funding has been cut over 40% since 2004,&quot; Lieberman said. &quot;If we begin to raise that back up . . . the city is going to get more money.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My ass hurts from laughing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All that support you gave him, all that money you spent to reelect him?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is your thanks, Mike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sucker</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116843240137723471/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116843240137723471&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116843240137723471'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116843240137723471'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/sucker.html' title='Sucker'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116840381195613946</id><published>2007-01-10T02:31:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-09T23:38:17.883-05:00</updated><title type='text'>We have no king</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/90059/bushshah.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/934186/bushshah.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/1/9/132412/5088&quot;&gt; The White House Threatens to Ignore Congress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Cenk Uygur&lt;br /&gt;Tue Jan 09, 2007 at 10:26:18 AM PST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The President has the ability to exercise his own authority if he thinks Congress has voted the wrong way.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tony Snow -- January 8, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We&#39;ve jumped the shark.

What does &quot;if he thinks Congress has voted the wrong way&quot; mean? Wrong, according to whom? The fact that it is a law makes it right by definition, by our democracy, by our constitution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Poppy Bush threatened to do this in 1990.

They know the opposite is true.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During one tense mission recently, U.S. army soldiers rolled up to the edge of the Shiite slum in hulking Stryker armoured vehicles. They never set foot inside, but they still got a sharp reaction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A burst of gunfire rang out moments after soldiers got out, prompting one squad to take cover in the home of an unemployed man named Abdul-Kareem Hassan Dhamin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More shooting followed, but then, just as suddenly, it stopped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Residents, accustomed to darting indoors during bursts of gunfire, peeked out and re-emerged. A line formed at a bread shop, and women with laundry baskets on their shoulders walked down the street. A man herded goats through a vacant lot strewn with trash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadr City could prove the toughest nut to crack as the administration of U.S. President George W. Bush appears ready to send thousands more soldiers to Baghdad to have a fresh run at pacifying the capital, where insurgent and militia violence has raged for months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iraqi government officials have said their troops, which are preparing to take on Sunni neighbourhoods, will largely leave Sadr City to American forces and the Iraqi army’s Special Operations Command division.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the recent U.S. mission, some squads conducted house-to-house searches while a group of soldiers holed up on the second floor of Dhamin’s home, peering across a street and over a wall into Sadr City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of the area is a slum, and there was little to look at but empty lots and crumbling hovels – although apartment buildings rose in the distance, providing ample cover for snipers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some soldiers crouched on the roof, using towels and blankets to create small barriers and make themselves harder to see. Another group moved into a second-floor bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;They know we’re here. We’re just seeing what their reaction will be,&quot; said Capt. Matt James, a Seattle native and commander of Company B, 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment. &quot;We’re not trying to provoke a response, but there will probably be one.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The largest Baghdad enclave of Iraq’s Shiite majority, Sadr City is the base for the Mahdi Army, a militia led by anti-U.S. cleric Muqtada al-Sadr. Under pressure from Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki in October, U.S. soldiers took down barbed-wire barricades that controlled traffic in and out of the area. Since then, they have ventured in only sparingly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But so many mortar and rocket attacks have been launched from the outskirts of Sadr City in recent weeks that U.S. commanders decided to raid homes nearby, searching for weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many soldiers wondered whether what they were looking for was worth the risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Every day we have a mission, but it’s hard to see how that helps accomplish what we came here to do, how it fits into the big picture,&quot; said Sgt. James Simons, 24, of Tacoma, Wash., a soldier in the battalion’s Company A.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How ugly could this get?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pavlov&quot; s_house=&quot;&quot;&gt;The building&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The house was a four-story building in the city centre of Stalingrad, built parallel to the embankment of the river Volga and overseeing a large square, the &quot;9th January Square&quot; (named for Bloody Sunday (1905)). The house was attacked by the German invaders in September 1942. A platoon of the 13th Guards Division was ordered to seize and defend it. The platoon was commanded by Yakov Pavlov, a junior commander replacing his wounded superior. They were successful, although only four men survived the combat. Together they went on defending the building on their own. After several days, reinforcements finally arrived, equipping the defenders with machine-guns, anti-tank rifles and mortars. The men, now a garrison of twenty-five, surrounded the building with barbed wire and minefields, and established anti-tank and machine-gun posts at the windows. For better internal communications and supplies they breached the walls in the basement and upper floors, and dug a communications trench to Soviet positions outside. Supplies were brought in via the trench or by boats crossing the river, defying German air raids and shelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevertheless food and especially water was in short supply. Lacking beds, the soldiers tried to sleep on insulation wool torn off pipes, yet usually the Germans kept shooting at the house with deafening machine-gun fire day and night. The Germans attacked the building several times a day. Each time German infantry or tanks tried to cross the square and to close in on the house, Pavlov&#39;s men took them under heavy fire from within the basement, from the windows and from the roof top. Leaving behind a square covered with corpses and steel, the Germans had to retreat again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eventually the defenders, as well as the Russian civilians who kept living in the basement all that time, held out during intensive fighting from 23 September until 25 November 1942, when they were relieved by counter-attacking Soviet forces&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bet that isn&#39;t in Dave Petraeus&#39;s playbook.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116841228466376685/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116841228466376685&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116841228466376685'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116841228466376685'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/pavlovs-house.html' title='Pavlov&#39;s House'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116841165616803983</id><published>2007-01-10T01:43:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-10T01:47:36.196-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Bush&#39;s fantasyland</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/895045/24iraq-medical2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/658243/24iraq-medical2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Richard Cohen actually makes a good point&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/col/story/486874p-409912c.html&quot;&gt;Bush myopia spurs&lt;br /&gt;Iraq fantasyland&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Let me explain. During the 2000 presidential campaign, Bush answered a question about why he so ardently supported capital punishment. He offered a number of reasons, but one - deterrence - prompted me to raise my hand and ask a followup: But, Sir, there is absolutely no evidence that capital punishment is a deterrent. To my absolute astonishment, Bush conceded my point: &quot;You&#39;re right. I can&#39;t prove it. But neither can the other side prove it&#39;s not.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ponder that answer for a while. What it means is not just that Bush embraced a famously irrational way of thinking - the logical fallacy often called &quot;proving a negative&quot; - but in this case he used it to overwhelm all evidence to the contrary.&lt;br /&gt;......................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Up against this kind of mentality, the rational man seeks comfort in fantasy. It was our fantasy that a new Iraqi government, formulated months ago, would so turn things around that Bush would begin a staged withdrawal. It was our fantasy that the November congressional elections would make a difference - and Bush would be forced, when he saw the clear sentiment of the American people, to reverse himself. It was our fantasy that the report of the Iraq Study Group (the Baker-Hamilton commission) would compel the President to rethink everything. In fact, their effort was wasted. They were the mullers. Bush was the decider. And so those who have decided otherwise - a couple of four-stars, maybe the chief spook and all those smart people throughout government and academia - are ignored. Bush listened to them when he agreed with them and refused to listen when he did not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The execution of Saddam Hussein was Iraq in a nutshell. Aside from the dead man at the end of the rope, nothing went the way the Americans wanted. It was sloppy, putrid with the stench of sectarian hatred and, as always, totally unnecessary. George Bush saw it differently by not, as is his custom, seeing it at all. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116841165616803983/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116841165616803983&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116841165616803983'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116841165616803983'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/bushs-fantasyland.html' title='Bush&#39;s fantasyland'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116840317215824634</id><published>2007-01-10T01:20:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-09T23:26:12.190-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Hubris, dude, you&#39;re not the only reader</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/09/business/10apple.1901x.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 250px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/09/business/10apple.1901x.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/10/technology/10apple.html?hp&amp;ex=1168405200&amp;amp;amp;amp;en=57dea2fcc0d93534&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt;Apple Introduces Innovative Cellphone&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By JOHN MARKOFF&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 10, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Jan. 9 — With characteristic showmanship, Steven P. Jobs introduced Apple’s long-awaited entry into the cellphone world Tuesday, pronouncing it an achievement on a par with the Macintosh and the iPod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The creation, the iPhone, priced at $499 or $599, will not be for everyone. It will be available with a single carrier, Cingular Wireless, at midyear. Its essential functions — music player, camera, Web browser and e-mail tool as well as phone — have become commonplace in hand-held devices.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it was the ability to fuse those elements with a raft of innovations and Apple’s distinctive design sense that had the crowd here buzzing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple’s goal, Mr. Jobs said, was to translate the Macintosh computer’s ease of operation into the phone realm. “We want to make it so easy to use that everyone can use it,” he said. And he was clearly betting on translating Apple’s success with the iPod music player to a hot category of multifunction devices. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116840317215824634/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116840317215824634&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116840317215824634'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116840317215824634'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/hubris-dude-youre-not-only-reader_10.html' title='Hubris, dude, you&#39;re not the only reader'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116841016681443578</id><published>2007-01-10T01:13:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-10T01:22:46.833-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Silicone</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/09/dining/10sili190.1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/09/dining/10sili190.1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Lars Klove for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hot Stuff&lt;br /&gt;By MARIAN BURROS&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 10, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SILICONE kitchen tools have been lending a playful, psychedelic air to kitchens across the country, especially those where stark, sophisticated stainless steel had been the coin of the realm. The new tools appear in colors from electric green and royal purple to sweetheart pink and terra cotta and come in every shape imaginable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until about a decade ago, Americans knew silicone, a synthetic rubber, mainly from Silly Putty and, more controversially, from breast implants. But in recent years cooks have been deluged with silicone spatulas, cake pans, muffin tins, potholders, colanders and ties.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, the designers are having a ball. And so are the manufacturers and retailers of housewares. According to HomeWorld Business, a magazine that serves the housewares industry, silicone products make up about 7 percent of the bakeware business. Sales of silicone bakeware for 2006 are expected to exceed 2.7 million units, up from 365,000 units in 2001, according to the magazine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What’s less clear is whether these products are as revolutionary in their use as they are in their appearance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After four days in the kitchen — ovens blasting, water boiling, microwave beeping — I have clear ideas about which pieces of silicone belong in my kitchen and which do not, even if I were starting from scratch. There were plenty of disappointments, but a lot of treats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s immediately dispense with a common myth about silicone baking pans, and a reason many people say they buy them: that they are nonstick and do not require greasing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those who once believed this can tell you about partial layers of cake left behind and about muffin tops in hand and muffin bottoms left in the cup. Stick resistant is a better description.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael Karyo, owner of SiliconeZone, which makes silicone cookware, agreed. “If any silicone manufacturer says you never have to grease a pan, no matter, they are not telling you the truth,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite many magical qualities, silicone is not Teflon. (In light of some questions about Teflon’s safety, this can be seen as a plus.) It is also not all things to all people: like glass and aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron, it is the best choice for some tasks in the kitchen and not for others. Used as a potholder or as a baking surface for cookies, it has no equal. Used to peel garlic or to squeeze lemons, it is unclear why anyone would bother.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The universally appealing qualities of silicone are its heat resistance; its flexibility, which allows you to fold it, flatten it and squish it into a drawer; its ease of washing; and its ability to go from oven or microwave to refrigerator, freezer, dishwasher (in most cases) and sometimes even to the dinner table, cutting down on the number and kinds of containers you need.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jen&#39;s mom bought me a silicone pot holder. It can do some amazing things. like flip a turkey. But it isn&#39;t exactly a precision instrument. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bought my sister silicone bakeware because she does a lot of it. The best stuff seems to be the flat sheets and the sil pats.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116841016681443578/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116841016681443578&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116841016681443578'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116841016681443578'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/silicone.html' title='Silicone'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116839860289441044</id><published>2007-01-10T01:07:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-09T22:10:02.916-05:00</updated><title type='text'>No</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/550325/16.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/277477/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-01-08-gallup-poll_x.htm&quot;&gt;Most say no to Iraq buildup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Updated 1/9/2007 7:20 AM ET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Susan Page, USA TODAY&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON — President Bush will outline his &quot;new way forward&quot; in Iraq on Wednesday to a nation that overwhelmingly opposes sending more U.S. troops and is increasingly skeptical that the war can be won.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A USA TODAY/Gallup Poll taken Friday through Sunday shows a daunting sales job ahead for the White House, which is considering a plan to deploy up to 20,000 additional U.S. troops to Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those surveyed oppose the idea of increased troop levels by 61%-36%. Approval of the job Bush is doing in Iraq has sunk to 26%, a record low.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;He certainly has the wind in his face,&quot; says Michael Franc, a former congressional aide now at the conservative Heritage Foundation. &quot;But that&#39;s not to say if he were to pursue a change in policy that proved to be successful, that those numbers wouldn&#39;t flip.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Views of the war will be difficult to change with rhetoric alone, says Steven Kull, director of the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland. And if the public expresses strong opposition to Bush&#39;s plan, he says, Congress &quot;may feel emboldened to exert what control they have to stop or at least make it more difficult for the president to move forward.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The survey of 1,004 adults, which has a margin of error of +/—3 percentage points, shows Americans pessimistic about the war and inclined to hold Bush responsible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among key findings:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Nearly half of those surveyed say the United States can&#39;t achieve its goals in Iraq regardless of how many troops it sends. One in four say U.S. goals can be achieved only with an increase in troop numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•Eight in 10 say the war has gone worse than the Bush administration expected. Of those people, 53% say Bush deserves &quot;a great deal&quot; of blame; 41% place a great deal of blame on Iraqi political leaders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;•By 72%-25%, Americans say Bush doesn&#39;t have a clear plan for handling the situation in Iraq. Congressional Democrats fare only a little better: 66%-25%.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even so, Democrats take control of Congress amid a wave of good feeling. By 2-to-1, Americans say they want congressional Democrats, not Bush, to have more influence over the direction of the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The president&#39;s overall job approval rating is 37%, up 2 percentage points from mid-December.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116839860289441044/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116839860289441044&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116839860289441044'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116839860289441044'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/no.html' title='No'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116839829423943821</id><published>2007-01-10T01:05:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-09T22:04:54.523-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Here&#39;s your history lesson, Joe</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/863093/scruffythebeltwayclown.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/19100/scruffythebeltwayclown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;entry_time&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://time-blog.com/swampland/2007/01/now_that_i_have_your_attention_1.html&quot;&gt;19:34 pm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;        &lt;span class=&quot;entry_info&quot;&gt;Posted by Joe Klein &lt;a class=&quot;iconsphere&quot; title=&quot;Related Blogs &amp;amp; Articles&quot; onclick=&quot;return Sphere.Widget.search(&#39;http://time-blog.com/swampland/2007/01/now_that_i_have_your_attention_1.html&#39;)&quot; href=&quot;http://www.sphere.com/search?q=sphereit:http://time-blog.com/swampland/&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                   &lt;!-- sphereit start --&gt;           &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I love it! First day of Swampitude and the left-wing blogosphere--which is overpopulated by illiberal leftists and reactionary progressives--is already attacking me: 24 mostly mingy comments about my Left Behind post, many of which seem to be steaming off a post by Greg Sargent, who writes a blog called The Horse&#39;s...Mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The illiberal left just hates it when I point out that the Democratic Party&#39;s naivete on national security--and the left wing tendency to assume every U.S. military action abroad is criminal--just aren&#39;t very &lt;em&gt;helpful&lt;/em&gt; electorally. The fact that I&#39;ve been opposed to the Iraq war ever since this 2002 article in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2071556/&quot;&gt;Slate&lt;/a&gt; just makes it all the more aggravating. But it&#39;s possible to have been against the war and to hope for the best in Iraq. I&#39;d bet that the overwhelming majority of Americans who now oppose the war are praying for a turn for the better in Iraq. Listening to the leftists, though, it&#39;s easy to assume that they are rooting for an American failure.&lt;br /&gt;And so a challenge to those who slagged me in their comments. Can you honestly say the following:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;       Even though I disagree with this escalation, I am hoping that General Petraeus succeeds in calming down Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;Does the thought even cross your mind? As for me, it&#39;s easy--I&#39;ve been rooting for U.S. success ever since the invasion because, after the overpowering arrogance and stupidity that led to this disaster, we owe some peace and stability to the Iraqis and the region. For the record, I&#39;m outraged Bush is ignoring the election results and the reality on the ground in Iraq. I think he is sending more young American lives into an impossible situation. I am fairly certain that Bush will wallow amongst our worst presidents for getting us into this mess. But I hope events prove me wrong. I don&#39;t even care if Bush gets credit for the &quot;victory&quot; and smirks all the way back to Texas. --joe klein&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Joe,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let me give you a suggestion. Go down to the Smithsonian bookstore and buy two books: Colonial Wars and Wars of National Liberation. They will explain why our colonial war in Iraq is doomed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, we cannot make peace in Iraq. David Petraeus is going to fail because he doesn&#39;t have enough men. They never did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, our word means nothing. We have ruined Iraq. Now we expect them to let us fix it after sending interns to run their country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;re not a veteran, you probably don&#39;t know many, but your assertion that we are rooting for failure is odious. We don&#39;t have to root, Bush will deliver failure for us. We want our kin home. Simple as that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can you honestly say placing the Shia in charge of Iraq is worth one more American life?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116839829423943821/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116839829423943821&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116839829423943821'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116839829423943821'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/heres-your-history-lesson-joe.html' title='Here&#39;s your history lesson, Joe'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116840946297802529</id><published>2007-01-10T01:04:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-10T01:11:03.233-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The adventures of Spocko</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/833991/buskmickey.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/749891/buskmickey.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=53574&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;News Analysis: Blogosphere Trumps Old Media In Disney/Spocko Dustup&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Tom Siebert, Tuesday, Jan 9, 2007 6:00 AM ET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;THE WALT DISNEY CO.&#39;S FAILURE to suppress access to controversial audio files from its ABC Radio affiliate KSFO is a textbook example of the impossibility of controlling the marketplace of ideas in the digital age.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like a swarm of tiny locusts overwhelming a massive mouse, it was fascinating to watch the blogosphere unite in defense of the online media critic Spocko last weekend. Disney had sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Web site Spocko&#39;s Brain and its ISP, 1&amp;amp;1, after the online muckraker taped segments of KSFO&#39;s morning talk show, posted them on his site, and invited the station&#39;s advertisers to listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What they heard was drive-time hosts endorse torture, insult Muslims and enact the execution of journalists. When some advertisers fled, the Disney legal department briefly killed the messenger with a cease-and-desist order, alleging copyright violation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But less than 48 hours after Spocko&#39;s case was brought to light on the progressive news blog &quot;The Daily Kos,&quot; several new Web hosts, including YouTube, Blogintegrity and Firedoglake, stepped up to provide access to audio files from KSFO. Instead of one ISP to threaten, there were now many--basically challenging MouseCorp to sue all of them.&lt;br /&gt;....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Disney is now left with the option of playing a virtual game of &quot;Whack A Mole,&quot; as the Rodent Empire&#39;s lawyers will need to slap citations against a series of sites as swiftly as they pop up. Plus, it may only be a matter of time before the mainstream media rides the story for at least one new cycle. That&#39;s got to be Disney&#39;s worst nightmare: 24 hours where &quot;Disney&quot; and &quot;Hate Speech&quot; are both part of the topic line.&lt;/blockquote&gt;We don&#39;t have to take this crap any more. That stuff was vile.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116840946297802529/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116840946297802529&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116840946297802529'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116840946297802529'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/adventures-of-spocko.html' title='The adventures of Spocko'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116832424111167989</id><published>2007-01-09T01:33:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-09T01:30:41.206-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Gratitude is essential</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/473542/ipod.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/506079/ipod.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/08/AR2007010801418.html&quot;&gt;It&#39;s Not All About the iPods, Oprah&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Eugene Robinson&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, January 9, 2007; Page A15&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There can&#39;t be more than a handful of people on Earth who are better at choosing their words than Oprah Winfrey. So I was stunned last week to read a quote from her that was so . . . so totally un-Oprah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was talking about the new $40 million school for poor young girls she has built in South Africa and her awareness that some people would ask why she hadn&#39;t spent that money to benefit poor students at home. She already gives millions to educate underprivileged children in the United States, and anyway, she told Newsweek, the two situations are different. South Africa has desperate poverty and rudimentary infrastructure. The American educational system may have its faults, but &quot;it does work.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Point made. But she wasn&#39;t done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;I became so frustrated with visiting inner-city schools that I just stopped going. The sense that you need to learn just isn&#39;t there,&quot; she said. &quot;If you ask the kids what they want or need, they will say an iPod or some sneakers. In South Africa, they don&#39;t ask for money or toys. They ask for uniforms so they can go to school.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh, no, she didn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s hard to know where to start. I guess the most charitable spin is that Oprah should visit some different schools. If she checks out some rich suburbs, for example, she&#39;ll find that kids there also want iPods -- and, yes, that they lust after overpriced sneakers, too. It&#39;s possible to argue that young people in the United States are overly materialistic, but not that the problem is confined to inner-city youths or is even worse among inner-city youths.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;And there&#39;s no way to put lipstick on the part about how &quot;the sense that you need to learn just isn&#39;t there&quot; among inner-city young people, who, by the way, tend to be African American and Hispanic.&lt;/span&gt; As a nation, we should be outraged that there are so many failing, dysfunctional schools in our inner cities. No one should make excuses for students who foolishly fail to understand how education can better their lives and who do their best to drag others down with them. But in the inner-city schools I&#39;ve visited, most students desperately want to learn -- just as Oprah, growing up poor in inner-city Milwaukee, wanted desperately to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;My mother has been defending this fiasco for a week or so. I thought it was more about Oprah&#39;s need for being worshiped than reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People are so desperate for an education, they join the military. Kids want iPods and sneakers as a way to keep their dignity and not be constantly reminded that they&#39;re poor. When poor kids are motivated, as they were in LA last year, they can do damn near anything, including shut down the LA school system via facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Oprah think&#39;s an iPod is a toy, she&#39;s a fool. Only a person familiar with computers can use an iPod. These are computer literate kids. And they get younger every year. The use of an iPod teaches technology, as do cell phones and video games. These kids are comfortable in a computerized world and use that information to learn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wouldn&#39;t you ask a billionaire for an iPod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Soros, can I have an iPod.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The South African government backed out of the project because it was too lavish.  Oprah is completely unaware of the political consequences of creating an elite in another country. I would bet that most of these girls spend their lives as expats in the US or UK.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what angers me is yet another attack, by a black person, on black and latino kids. She isn&#39;t an educator, she doesn&#39;t know what a drive to learn is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Jesse James had Monster Garage on Discovery, he would go to a poor school, white, latino, black, shitty neighborhoods.  Like he grew up in. And he would teach them how to build a car. These kids wanted to learn.  Even if James had to hunt down one kid at home. They were excited to learn this skill, which took little imagination to see what career it led to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every time some people want to make a point, they just whip out the canards and then attack black kids. Most of who graduate high school  and then go to college. Oprah wanted people to be grateful, even if she slanders a few people in the process</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116832424111167989/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116832424111167989&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832424111167989'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832424111167989'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/gratitude-is-essential.html' title='Gratitude is essential'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116832112757888417</id><published>2007-01-09T01:32:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-09T00:39:35.356-05:00</updated><title type='text'>About Tal Afar</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20070105/i/r4000710792.jpg?x=380&amp;y=290&amp;amp;sig=r75tMWBcU9uj..L6.cYcuw--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20070105/i/r4000710792.jpg?x=380&amp;y=290&amp;amp;sig=r75tMWBcU9uj..L6.cYcuw--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;David Petraeus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is from Pat Lang&#39;s blog&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/2007/01/sgt_york_on_pet.html&quot;&gt; Sgt. York on Petraeus&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sgt. York is one of our regular commenters who has forwarded these comments on; counterinsurgency, Tel Afar, Barry McCaffery, David Petraeus and, I suppose, Juan Cole.  pl&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;br /&gt;&quot;For you Juan Cole fans... he seems to be enamored with Petrauus and impressed that Petreous authored THE manual on counterinsurgency which Juan apparently has not bother to read. If he had, he would have noted that Petreous espouses the clear-hold-build doctrine and cites Tal Afar as a shining example of a successful counterinsurgency strategy. By the way, it&#39;s not a realistic strategy to surround Baghdad with an 8-foot earthen berm, flatten the city using artillery and air bombardment, and then &#39;vet&#39; the refugees as they return to the rubble that was once a city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUAN COLE ON PETRAEUS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Adults take Charge: The Reality Based Community Strikes Back in Iraq -- The professionals take charge. Bush is bringing in Ryan Crocker, a distinguished career foreign service officer, as the new US ambassador to Iraq. And Gen. David Petraeus will replace Gen. Casey as top ground commander in Iraq...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petraeus is among the real experts on counter-insurgency, and did a fine job of making friends and mending fences when he was in charge of Mosul. Crocker has been ambassador to Kuwait, Syria, Lebanon and Pakistan, and knows the region intimately (as does Khalilzad).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wish these seasoned professionals well. They know what they are getting into, and it is an index of their courage and dedication that they are willing to risk their lives in an effort that the American public has largely written off as a costly failure. If the US in Iraq can possibly have a soft landing, these are the individuals who can pull it off.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JUAN COLE ON TAL AFAR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NYT reports Gen. Barry McCaffrey, who teaches at West Point, as estimating that the US military should have a big presence in Iraq for 5 to 7 years, while partnering with and building up the Iraqi military... My problem with that is that they seem to think that the Tal Afar operation was a success, whereas it is a political disaster, and if they are planning another 5 to 7 years of that sort of thing, then we are doomed. At Tal Afar they used Kurdish and Shiite troops to assault Sunni Turkmen, emptied the city on the grounds that it was full of foreign fighters, killed people and made them refugees, and then only took 50 foreign fighters captive. The Sunni Turkmen, not to mention the Turks in Ankara, will never forgive us... But you can&#39;t just empty out one Sunni city after another, bring in troops of other ethnicities to level neighborhoods, force people into tent cities in the desert or into relatives&#39; homes, and call that a counter-insurgency strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PETRAEUS ON TAL AFAR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the summer of 2005, the 3d Armored Calvary Regiment (3d ACR), assumed the lead for military efforts in and around Tal Afar. In the months that followed, the 3d ACR applied a clear-hold-build approach to reclaim Tal Afar from the insurgents... Iraqi security forces and U.S. Soldiers isolated the insurgents from external support by controlling nearby border areas and creating an eight-foot-high berm around the city. The berm’s purpose was to deny the enemy freedom of movement or safe haven in outlying communities. The berm prevented free movement of fighters and weapons and forced all traffic to go through security checkpoints that were manned by U.S. and Iraqi forces... The forces conducted house-to-house searches. When significant violent resistance led to battle, combat included the use of precision fires from artillery and aviation. Hundreds of insurgents were killed or captured during the encirclement and clearing of the city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ARAB PRESS ON TAL AFAR&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the wake of a savage US offensive on the city of Tal Afar, residents have begun returning home, only to find that their houses destroyed, no water available and that they must generate their own electricity if they want the luxury of power... returning residents have been shocked at the scale of destruction wreaked on the homes and shops in city by the US onslaught Most buildings in the city have been reduced to rubble... following the ferocious US bombing and shelling that lasted for days on end. Many families have been forced to live in tents pitched atop the mounds of rubble that once were their homes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Flocking back home after the end of the US-Iraqi onslaught, residents of the northern town of Tal Afar found their homes flattened to the ground and their hometown turned into a ghost city. US air strikes and bombardment have sent residents into panicky flight from the city, which is populated by a majority of Sunni Arabs and also Shiite Turkomans. Some left for the nearby city of Mosul or ended up in a refugee camp on the city’s peripheries where they face serious shortages of clean water, food and medicine.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;=========================================&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Posted by: Sgt.York | 07 January 2007 at 04:30 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116832112757888417/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116832112757888417&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832112757888417'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832112757888417'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/about-tal-afar.html' title='About Tal Afar'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116831333681178680</id><published>2007-01-09T01:28:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T22:28:56.860-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Osama who?</title><content type='html'>&lt;h2&gt;           &lt;a class=&quot;post-title&quot; href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/01/08/theres-a-surge-in-afghanistan-too/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent Link to Surging in Afghanistan&quot;&gt;             Surging in Afghanistan          &lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/h2&gt;          &lt;!-- Print the time the article was posted --&gt;          &lt;div class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/index.php?author=70&quot;&gt;Scarecrow&lt;/a&gt; @ 1:30 pm&lt;/div&gt;          &lt;!-- The article content --&gt;         &lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;           &lt;p&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;image6037&quot; src=&quot;http://static.firedoglake.com/2006/12/burkatank.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;burkatank.jpg&quot; height=&quot;195&quot; width=&quot;300&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the White House continues to make daily announcements to remind us that the President is talking to advisers about an Iraq plan, working on an Iraq plan, deciding the details of an Iraq plan, about to announce an Iraq plan and . . . wait for it . . . actually &lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070108/pl_nm/iraq_bush_usa_dc_4&quot;&gt;scheduling a speech&lt;/a&gt; about the Iraq plan (jeeze, do these guys crave attention!), we should ask, &lt;em&gt;what&#39;s happening in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/12/14/that-other-good-war/&quot;&gt;that other war&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; You know, the one we began to go after the murderers who attacked us on 9/11? The short answer is, the White House is not &quot;thinking&quot; about Afghanistan but is instead hoping no one will notice that all the attention focused on surging more troops into Iraq means that the &quot;good war&quot; most Americans actually support will continue to worsen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;David Wood of the &lt;em&gt;Baltimore Sun&lt;/em&gt; (by way of Boston Globe) summarizes what we&#39;re not supposed to be watching: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boston.com/news/world/asia/articles/2007/01/08/commanders_seek_more_forces_in_afghanistan/&quot;&gt;Commanders seek more forces in Afghanistan&lt;/a&gt;. Not only are the US and NATO forces already stretched for enough troops to deal with a resurgent Taliban, but some of the US troops already there are scheduled to be part of the &quot;surge&quot; into Iraq.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;KABUL, Afghanistan — Taliban forces, shattered and ejected from Afghanistan by the US military five years ago, are poised for a major offensive against US troops and undermanned NATO forces. This has prompted US commanders here to issue an urgent appeal for a new US Marine Corps battalion to reinforce the American positions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NATO&#39;s 30,000 troops in Afghanistan are supposed to have taken responsibility for security operations. But Taliban attacks have risen sharply, and senior US officers here describe the NATO operation as weak, hobbled by a shortage of manpower and equipment, and by restrictions put on the troops by their capitals….&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Bush is expected to announce this week the dispatch of thousands of additional troops to Iraq as a stopgap measure. Such an order, Pentagon officials say, would strain the Army and Marine Corps as they man both wars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A US Army battalion fighting in a critical area of eastern Afghanistan is due to be withdrawn within weeks to deploy to Iraq&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Army Brigadier General Anthony J. Tata and other US commanders say that will happen as the Taliban is expected to unleash a campaign to cut the vital road between Kabul and Kandahar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The official said the Taliban intend to seize Kandahar, Afghanistan&#39;s second-largest city, where the group was organized in the 1990s. With NATO unable or unwilling to stem the rising violence, the Taliban are pressing their advantage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Rather than withdrawing to regroup over the winter, intelligence officials and combat commanders said, the Taliban forces — clad in new cold-weather boots and fleece jackets — are fighting through the bitter cold months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&quot;It is bleak,&quot; said Colonel Chris Haas, commander of the Joint Special Operations Task Force in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conway said US commanders understand that the Afghan war is an &quot;economy of force&quot; operation, a military term for &lt;strong&gt;a mission that is given minimal resources because it is a secondary priority, in this case behind Iraq&lt;/strong&gt;. [emphasis mine]&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt; To sum up, we&#39;re about to have three surges simultaneously (nice parallel with King Abdullah&#39;s three civil wars scenario, which is also on track, but that&#39;s another story). We will surge US troops &lt;em&gt;into&lt;/em&gt; Iraq; to allow that, we will surge US troops &lt;em&gt;out of &lt;/em&gt;Afghanistan; to take advantage of that, the Taliban will surge &lt;em&gt;all over &lt;/em&gt;Afghanistan.

Other sources said it was launched at night from the U.S. military facility in neighboring Djibouti. It was based on joint military-CIA intelligence and on information provided by Ethiopian and Kenyan military forces operating in the border area.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;It was the first acknowledged U.S. military action inside Somalia since 1994, when President Bill Clinton withdrew U.S. troops after a failed operation in Mogadishu that led to the deaths of 18 Army Rangers and Delta Force special operations soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sources said last night that initial reports indicated the attack had been successful, although information was still scanty.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US has had a presence in the Horn of Africa since 2002, and tried to assist the current Somali government late last year.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116832307155824272/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116832307155824272&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832307155824272'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832307155824272'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/well-they-killed-someone.html' title='Well, they killed someone'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116832281002833533</id><published>2007-01-09T01:04:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-09T01:06:50.043-05:00</updated><title type='text'>No surge for Brits</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/309004/blair.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/817522/blair.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=427298&amp;amp;in_page_id=1770&quot;&gt;Blair refuses to match US troop &#39;surge&#39; in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last updated at 16:53pm on 8th January 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Tony Blair will make clear this week that Britain is not going to send more troops to Iraq even if the US pushes ahead with a &quot;surge&quot; of 20,000 extra soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Prime Minister will insist that the UK will stick to its own strategy of gradually handing over to the Iraqi army, as it has been doing with success in Basra and the south. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116832281002833533/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116832281002833533&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832281002833533'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832281002833533'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/no-surge-for-brits.html' title='No surge for Brits'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116832239336003084</id><published>2007-01-09T00:51:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-09T00:59:53.400-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Hell with a smile</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/272519/google_investors.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/853813/google_investors.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/bestcompanies/2007/snapshots/1.html&quot;&gt;Working for Google&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;At Google it always comes back to the food. Google runs 11 free gourmet cafeterias at its Mountain View, Calif., headquarters, and offers all its employees free gourmet meals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to its cafés, Google has snack rooms which contain various cereals, candy, nuts, yogurt, carrots, fresh fruit and other snacks, and dozens of different drinks including soda and make-your-own cappuccino. Says co-founder Sergey Brin: &quot;The cafés have always been pretty healthy, but the snacks are not, and the efforts to fix that have been remarkably challenging.&quot; Though company lore has it that Brin and co-founder Larry Page believe no worker should be more than 150 feet from a food source, clearly not all food is equal. &quot;A lot of people like their M&amp;Ms. But the easy access is actually what&#39;s bad for them,&quot; he says.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, when it comes to America&#39;s new Best Company to Work For, the food is, well, just the appetizer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; Spring cleaning&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Google takes the work-life balance to a new level. A Googler who&#39;s pressed for time can get plenty of errands done while at work. Employees can do laundry for free in company washers and dryers (free detergent too) or drop off dry cleaning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Among Google&#39;s many other conveniences offered to its employees: a workout room with weights and rowing machine, locker rooms, a massage room, child care, onsite notaries, car services and five onsite doctors available for employee checkups, free of charge.&lt;br /&gt;...............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Google campus is a pet-friendly facility, and dogs are allowed on a temporary basis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though having dogs around can brighten up the workplace, Google managament realizes it can cause problems as well. From Google&#39;s Dog Policy: &quot;Aggressive behavior, such as growling, barking, chasing or biting, is unacceptable and the pet will have to be taken home on the first complaint. Employees with allergic reactions to dogs may ask the owner to refrain from bringing the dog to the workplace if the presence of the dogs makes it difficult for the allergic employee to work. Pets with evidence of fleas will be asked to go home until the problem has been alleviated. Owners are responsible for cleaning up after pets at all times.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; Search and enjoy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Life for Google employees at the Mountain View campus is like college. It feels like the brainiest university imaginable - one in which every kid can afford a sports car (though geeky hybrids are cooler here than hot rods).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here the shabbily dressed engineers always will be the big men (and, yes, women) on campus. &quot;Hard-core geeks are here because there&#39;s no place they&#39;d rather be,&quot; says Dennis Hwang, a Google Webmaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another similarity to college: New Googlers (Nooglers, in Google parlance) tend to pile on the &quot;Google 15&quot; when confronted with all the free food.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; Hanging around&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Work is such a cozy place that it&#39;s sometimes difficult for Google employees to leave the office, which is precisely how the company justifies the expenses, none of which it breaks out of its administrative costs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even people who don&#39;t work here like to loiter: The company has become a stop on the world lecture circuit, attracting the likes of Mikhail Gorbachev, Margaret Thatcher and Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. &quot;You&#39;ve got to ask yourself why these people are coming here,&quot; says 24-year-old engineer Neha Narula. &quot;I think they come here to be energized by the people at Google.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s a simple question: if the company does everything for you, why would you have a social life? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite all the happy talk, this is hellish. The boundary between your private life and work is demolished. Google calls it perks, but what it really does is keep people working longer hours and compliant to the company&#39;s needs, even over their own personal issues.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116832239336003084/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116832239336003084&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832239336003084'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116832239336003084'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/hell-with-smile.html' title='Hell with a smile'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116830628359040776</id><published>2007-01-08T20:21:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T20:31:23.613-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Dillitante speaks</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/196353/scruffythebeltwayclown.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/496364/scruffythebeltwayclown.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scruffy the Washington Pundit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Klein &lt;a href=&quot;http://time-blog.com/swampland/2007/01/left_behind.html&quot;&gt;embarasses &lt;/a&gt;himself once again&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m afraid I&#39;m going to get cranky about this: The Democrats who oppose the so-called &quot;surge&quot; are right. But they have to be careful not to sound like ill-informed dilettantes when talking about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The latest to make a fool of himself is Paul Krugman of the New York Times, who argues that those who favor the increase in troops are either cynical or delusional. Mostly the latter. Delusional neocons like Bill Kristol and Fred Kagan, to be precise. But what about retired General Jack Keane--whom Krugman doesn&#39;t mention--and the significant number of military intellectuals who have favored a labor-intensive counterinsurgency strategy in Baghdad for the past three years? They are serious people. They may be wrong about Iraq now, reflexively trying to complete a mission that has been lost, but they are not delusional. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fas.org/irp/doddir/army/fm3-24fd.pdf&quot;&gt;counterinsurgency doctrine &lt;/a&gt;they published in 2006 is exactly what the U.S. military should be doing in places like Afghanistan. And they, not Kagan and Kristol, are the motivating force behind Bush&#39;s new policy. As for K &amp;amp; K, Krugman&#39;s right: they&#39;ve been wrong about Iraq. But at least they&#39;ve taken the trouble to read the doctrine and talk to key players like Keane and General David Petraeus. Liberals won&#39;t ever be trusted on national security until they start doing their homework. --Joe Klein&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shut the fuck up, you ill-informed twit. Casey and Abizaid both opposed a surge. They read the doctrine and thought it was bullshit. Jack Keane was told that there weren&#39;t enough troops by the Pentagon. Not some AEI assclown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You have no more knowledge, and I bet a great deal less than Krugman, about who is right. Most of the military thinks this is insane, and only those who want to suck up to the president are pushing this plan of madness.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116830628359040776/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116830628359040776&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116830628359040776'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116830628359040776'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/dillitante-speaks.html' title='Dillitante speaks'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116830563016517672</id><published>2007-01-08T20:19:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T20:20:30.193-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Yeah right</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://mywebpages.comcast.net/duncanblack/time.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://mywebpages.comcast.net/duncanblack/time.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116830563016517672/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116830563016517672&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116830563016517672'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116830563016517672'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/yeah-right.html' title='Yeah right'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116824055203216348</id><published>2007-01-08T14:11:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T04:27:08.980-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Resist</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/800311/no%20surge.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/606538/no%20surge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not have to sit by and let Bush get more people killed.

He recently appeared at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aei.org/events/eventID.1446,filter.all/event_detail.asp&quot;&gt;AEI event&lt;/a&gt; with the other surge architect, Ret. Gen. Jack Keane (along with surge advocates Sens. McCain and Lieberman), to detail and defend his plan. Kagan thereafter issued an &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.25396,filter.all/pub_detail.asp&quot;&gt;Executive Summary&lt;/a&gt;&quot; to accompany a report detailing what the &quot;surge&quot; plan requires in order to succeed (h/t &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.progressiveblendradio.com/&quot;&gt;Chasm&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kagan makes it absolutely clear that an &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;increase in the number of available troops and American military volunteers &lt;/span&gt;is critical to the success of the surge specifically, and for &quot;victory&quot; in the war in Iraq generally, and he therefore emphasizes how urgent it is for more Americans to enlist in the military if we are to Win:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;BodyText&quot;&gt;Victory in Iraq is still possible at an acceptable level of effort. We must adopt a new approach to the war and implement it quickly and decisively. . . . &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;BodyText&quot;&gt;This approach requires a &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;national commitment to victory&lt;/span&gt; in Iraq:&lt;br /&gt;. . .&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;BodyText&quot;&gt;The president must request a substantial increase in ground forces end strength. This increase is vital to sustaining the morale of the combat forces by ensuring that relief is on the way. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The president must issue a personal call for young Americans to volunteer to fight in the decisive conflict of this generation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;BodyText&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Motherfucker, no.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let Bush do something that fucking stupid, please.

[By Way of Disclosure] &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I&#39;m writing this post partly to introduce myself, and partly (I hope) as a comment of interest in itself. I recently almost got a job as a monthly columnist for a well-known national print publication. It would have been a lot of fun - and visibility - with a chance to reach even more readers than the Huffington Post, and to start conversations that need to be started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;However ... when I took a look at the contract, I couldn&#39;t sign the bit that says &quot;without limitation ... take no money from potential news sources.&quot; Not &quot;take no money from any subject of a column without disclosing your interest,&quot; but no money, period.&lt;/span&gt; The very thing that I thought made me an ideal commentator - I&#39;m part of the IT/Internet industry, I know what it means to launch a product, see one fail, try to raise funding, negotiate a deal, manage relations with a competitor - those very experiences were disqualifying me.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I had thought that disclosure would be good enough. I like to hear what people with vested interests have to say; they probably know what they are talking about. Conflict of interest is a fraught topic. As we used to say when I worked on Wall Street: &quot;Two [related] investments is a conflict; three is synergy!&quot; Of course, I like to know where people are coming from; that gives me what I need to assess their biases and motivations. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Listen you guiless hack, maybe because you have made so much money from your CEO friends selling their bullshit, you don&#39;t get this, but when you work for a publication, any publication, you disclose who pays you, so they can trust what they tell you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the unfamiliar, Dyson is an old time snake oil salesman from back in the day. People used to pay $1200 a year for her insights.   Her main skill was basically sucking up to CEO&#39;s and then telling them what they wanted to hear.&lt;br /&gt;&#39;&lt;br /&gt;Dyson is no idiot, far from it. Her father is a nobel prize winning physicist, and she started her journalism career with Fortune.  She was one of those digerati clods, who had this image of an internet which meshed nicely with corporate America.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#39;s now in the blogs, or on Huff Po, because as Dr. Phil Says, it&#39;s a soft place to land. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find her arrogance amusing. She thinks she can work for a major publication and still invest and take money from sources?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I took regular cash payments from Al Gore for &quot;consulting&quot; services, would you trust me? Certainly not as much as you would when I say I don&#39;t work for politicians. Why? Because, everything I said would be reflected in the mirror that I get paid by Al Gore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Pogue is a perfect example of how one can actually be ethical and have corporate relationships. He writes for the Times, but clearly has a relationship with Apple. They don&#39;t pay him, but he is the leading Apple expert in the popular computing press. He has an interest in&lt;br /&gt;writing about and promoting Apple products, but they don&#39;t pay him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dyson, who should know better, seems to be confused by the concept of being loyal to, oh, the readers. When you write for a publication, you can&#39;t take money from the people you write about. Real simple.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116824978316777745/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116824978316777745&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116824978316777745'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116824978316777745'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-cant-these-people-go-away.html' title='Why can&#39;t these people go away'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116824003505171282</id><published>2007-01-08T01:45:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T02:07:15.146-05:00</updated><title type='text'>22,950 dead in 2006, they think.</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20070107/capt.bag10601071318.iraq_bag106.jpg?x=380&amp;y=267&amp;amp;sig=AaAKzZVA.3_SykD3mgWjEg--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20070107/capt.bag10601071318.iraq_bag106.jpg?x=380&amp;y=267&amp;amp;sig=AaAKzZVA.3_SykD3mgWjEg--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;(AP Photo/Samir Mizban)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/07/AR2007010701359.html&quot;&gt; War&#39;s Toll on Iraqis Put at 22,950 in &#39;06&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Statistics From Health Ministry Official Show Tripling of Civilian, Police Deaths&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Sudarsan Raghavan&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Foreign Service&lt;br /&gt;Monday, January 8, 2007; Page A01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan. 7 -- More than 17,000 Iraqi civilians and police officers died violently in the latter half of 2006, according to Iraqi Health Ministry statistics, a sharp increase that coincided with rising sectarian strife since the February bombing of a landmark Shiite shrine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the first six months of last year, 5,640 Iraqi civilians and police officers were killed, but that number more than tripled to 17,310 in the latter half of the year, according to data provided by a Health Ministry official with direct knowledge of the statistics. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information, said those numbers remained incomplete, suggesting the final tally of violent deaths could be higher.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Much of last year&#39;s politically motivated bloodshed unfolded in Baghdad. The Bush administration is considering sending more U.S. troops there, as the newly ascendant Democrats in Congress press for a military withdrawal. Bringing stability and rule of law to the capital is a cornerstone of the administration&#39;s strategy to exit Iraq. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki announced over the weekend his own security push to tame Baghdad&#39;s sectarian strife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last year&#39;s spike in casualties occurred despite an ambitious U.S. military operation in the capital, Together Forward, that involved thousands of U.S. and Iraqi troops cordoning off some of the deadliest neighborhoods and conducting house-to-house searches.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We have been in a reaction mode in many ways to the events that occurred because of the [February] bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra, and that began a cycle of sectarian violence that we&#39;ve been working very, very, very hard to keep under control,&quot; Lt. Gen. Peter W. Chiarelli, the former second-ranking commander in Iraq, told reporters last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Now, I&#39;m not in any way happy with what I see in Baghdad. The level of violence is way too high,&quot; he added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Health Ministry&#39;s full-year death toll of 22,950, although incomplete, is higher than the 13,896 violent deaths of civilians, police officers and soldiers reported Jan. 1 by Iraq&#39;s ministries of defense, health and interior. The United Nations, in a November report, estimated that more than 28,000 Iraqi civilians had died violently in the first 10 months of 2006, but that count was disputed by the government. The differences in the numbers could not be reconciled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iraq&#39;s death toll from violence is controversial because it provides a vivid report card on the difficulty of U.S. and Iraqi efforts to bring order to the country. Neither the U.S. government nor the military provides death totals for Iraqis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It is often very difficult to gain consensus on the numbers of casualties in Iraq. It really is a government of Iraq issue,&quot; said Lt. Col. Christopher C. Garver, a U.S. military spokesman. U.S. and Iraqi officials have discouraged Baghdad&#39;s medical officials from releasing morgue count&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116824003505171282/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116824003505171282&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116824003505171282'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116824003505171282'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/22950-dead-in-2006-they-think.html' title='22,950 dead in 2006, they think.'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116823799480047128</id><published>2007-01-08T01:26:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T01:33:14.816-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Four years too late</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070108/2007_01_08t000912_450x286_us_iraq_usa_benchmarks.jpg?x=380&amp;y=241&amp;amp;sig=e7uHZk8BCTGS82AVmaEtlQ--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070108/2007_01_08t000912_450x286_us_iraq_usa_benchmarks.jpg?x=380&amp;y=241&amp;amp;sig=e7uHZk8BCTGS82AVmaEtlQ--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;(Kareem Raheem/Reuters)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1984883,00.html&quot;&gt;Bush $1bn jobs plan to draw Iraqis into fold&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ed Pilkington in New York&lt;br /&gt;Monday January 8, 2007&lt;br /&gt;The Guardian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;President George Bush will this week announce a renewed reconstruction package for Iraq costing up to $1bn (£500m) and a fresh push by a reinforced Iraqi army to quell the insurgency in Baghdad to sweeten the pill of his decision to dispatch up to 20,000 more US soldiers to the fray.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Bush&#39;s determination to reject the advice of the Baker-Hamilton review, which recommended a gradual withdrawal, continues to cause deep unease both in military and Congressional circles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a speech on Wednesday, Mr Bush will give details of a deal thrashed out last week between him and the Iraqi prime minister, Nuri al-Maliki, in which the US troop increase of up to five combat brigades, on top of the 130,000 personnel already on the ground, would be matched by a rise in Iraqi army numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three more Iraqi brigades are to be sent to Baghdad over the next weeks. Two of those brigades will be made up of peshmerga fighters from the Kurdish north of the country, which is likely to prompt questions about their effectiveness. Kurdish leaders have shown a desire to remain outside the sectarian violence escalating between Sunni and Shia communities to the south.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other sweetener will be a doubling of reconstruction efforts. Up to $1bn is to be spent on a programme in which Iraqis are employed to clean the streets and repair and paint schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pentagon-run scheme would try to draw young men away from insurgent groups and back into the mainstream economy. It would be administered by officials embedded in US combat brigades in a bid to persuade Iraqis that the Americans were there as a force for good and not just of occupation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After so many dead and so much failure, they think jobs will change people minds?  Oh yeah, sign up for this and wait for the car bombs to show up. Who the fuck are they kidding? This makes you an employee of the Americans and that gets people killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as we mentioned yesterday, Kurds in Baghdad? Are they kidding?  Yeah, this plan doesn&#39;t suck.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116823799480047128/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116823799480047128&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116823799480047128'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116823799480047128'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/four-years-too-late.html' title='Four years too late'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116823751907770194</id><published>2007-01-08T01:20:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T01:25:19.093-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Wal Mart will lie to America</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/814137/walmart.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/249333/walmart.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/wire/ap/archive.html?wire=D8MGKC200.html&quot;&gt; Wal-Mart Will Defend Reputation in Ads&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;- - - - - - - - - - - -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By MARCUS KABEL AP Business Writer&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;January 07,2007 | -- Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will run national television ads starting Monday praising its record as an employer and corporate citizen, taking its arguments straight to the public in an ongoing battle over its reputation with unions and other critics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world&#39;s largest retailer, increasingly a lightening rod for politicians as well as labor unions and other activists, cites the legacy of late founder Sam Walton in a folksy 60-second ad. A 30-second ad focuses on Wal-Mart&#39;s health insurance plans for its more than 1.3 million U.S. employees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It all began with a big dream in a small town, Sam Walton&#39;s dream,&quot; a narrator says as one ad starts with a black-and-white photo of Sam Walton and a grainy shot of Walton&#39;s first five-and-dime store in what is now the chain&#39;s headquarters town of Bentonville, Ark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Sam&#39;s dream.

BURNS&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 8, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan. 7 — The new American operational commander in Iraq said Sunday that even with the additional American troops likely to be deployed in Baghdad under President Bush’s new war strategy it might take another “two or three years” for American and Iraqi forces to gain the upper hand in the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The commander, Lt. Gen. Raymond T. Odierno, assumed day-to-day control of war operations last month in the first step of a makeover of the American military hierarchy here. In his first lengthy meeting with reporters, General Odierno, 52, struck a cautious note about American prospects, saying much will depend on whether commanders can show enough progress to stem eroding support in the United States for the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I believe the American people, if they feel we are making progress, they will have the patience,” he said. But right now, he added, “I think the frustration is that they think we are not making progress.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116823685343877170/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116823685343877170&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116823685343877170'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116823685343877170'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/war-without-end.html' title='War without end'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116823664642353749</id><published>2007-01-08T01:08:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-08T01:10:46.450-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Prince William&#39;s New Job</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42356000/jpg/_42356347_williamparade2_pa203b.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://newsimg.bbc.co.uk/media/images/42356000/jpg/_42356347_williamparade2_pa203b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6239599.stm&quot;&gt;William begins new life in Army&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Prince William is beginning life as an Army officer after arriving at the barracks of his new regiment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;William, who is second in line to the throne, will report for duty later for his first official day with the Household Cavalry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 24-year-old, who is joining the Blues and Royals regiment, will be based at Combermere Barracks, Windsor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After his first year in the Army, the prince will turn his attention to constitutional affairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This process will be in anticipation of when he eventually accedes the throne.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By joining the Army, William is following in the footsteps of younger brother Harry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And in preparation for his future position as head of the armed forces, William will also spend time with the RAF and Navy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116823664642353749/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116823664642353749&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116823664642353749'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116823664642353749'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/prince-williams-new-job.html' title='Prince William&#39;s New Job'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116820284736027025</id><published>2007-01-07T15:42:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-07T15:47:27.406-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Nothing left to give</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/84572/marinewatch.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/798214/marinewatch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/1/7/25018/73642&quot;&gt;Broken &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Craig Burnham&lt;br /&gt;Sun Jan 07, 2007 at 12:11:44 AM PST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I want to share with everyone here and experience that I had the other night. I was over at a friends house, and we were having a little party. After about an hour or so a limo rolls up, and I see my old friend Andy come out. Andy is in the Army, and he just returned a few weeks ago from an 18 month deployment in Iraq. I went to high school with Andy, and we played baseball together. We partied all throughout high school, and we had some great times.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I could tell right from the second I hugged him that he had changed. He was hammered. He has been hammered just about every day since he returned from Iraq, so his best friend later told me. I asked Andy how he was doing. He said &quot;I just got back from Iraq, how the hell do you think i&#39;m doing&quot;. Of course he&#39;s not doing good, after an 18 month tour in Iraq i&#39;m not sure how I would be. But he kept going. &quot;I&#39;m broken, I&#39;ve just returned from the worst experience in my life.&quot; I can&#39;t imagine what he went through, and to be honest I didn&#39;t want to ask him any specifics. Still he kept going.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I want to go back.&quot; At that point I nearly spit out my beer. He wants to go back. I asked him why, and he responded &quot;I killed someone, I killed many people. I&#39;ve seen shit that I hope no one ever has to see in their lives. But I want to go back. I came back here after being there for 18 months and I get no respect.&quot; He was visibly shaken. It may have been the fact that he was very very drunk, but I could still tell he was shaken. &quot;I&#39;m on five different medications right now, they&#39;ve diagnosed me with PTSD.&quot; Post traumatic stress disorder, which i&#39;m sure just about everyone here is familiar with, is a problem plaguing the soldiers coming back from Iraq. He went on to tell me about his lack of sleep and his vivid nightmares. But what he told me next shook me to the core.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Andy told me his best friend from the service became paralyzed from the waist down after an IED attack. He returned from Iraq to his home, to his wife, and to his child. His wife left him, and took the child with him. He was left without a job, and without anyone to take care of him. He was also diagnosed with PTSD. About a week ago, Andy&#39;s friend killed himself. Andy told me &quot;I might be next.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This war has become more and more personal to me. Before this encounter with Andy, the war really wasnt personalized. Sure, I know a few people who went there, but I didn&#39;t really know these people. These were kids from my high school, and kids from surrounding towns that I had met on an occasion or two. But never someone that I had known well before, and someone who was noticeably different after the experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m really at a loss of words right now, but I do know one thing. It&#39;s time for us to end this fucking war once and for all. Immediate withdrawl is our only option. And we must, we must impeach this fucking excuse of a President. He has caused the deaths of over 3,000 American Soldiers. He has caused physical and mental damage to tens of thousands of soldiers. He has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands of Iraqis. And who knows what&#39;s going to come next. But here&#39;s what I know. It needs to stop. It needs to stop now. We voted for a stop of the Iraq war on November 7th, and our newly elected Democratic Congress cannot fuck up the oppourunity to fix this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Withdrawl needs to happen now, and then we need to impeach this son of a bitch, before more of our soldiers return broken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Update: I should mention that Andy is a pseudonym to protect his identity should anyone recognize me or him&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116820284736027025/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116820284736027025&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116820284736027025'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116820284736027025'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/nothing-left-to-give.html' title='Nothing left to give'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116819237603229952</id><published>2007-01-07T12:52:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-07T12:54:37.536-05:00</updated><title type='text'>No more blank check</title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Iraq&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height=&quot;350&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://youtube.com/v/o1hyVewBn6I&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://youtube.com/v/o1hyVewBn6I&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    SCHIEFFER: So, you’ve told him what you don’t want to do, and that is to expand the size of the force in Iraq even on a short-term basis. But what if he decides to do that? What will be your action then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    PELOSI: If the president chooses to escalate the war, in his budget request we want to see a distinction between what is there to support the troops who are there now. The American people and the Congress support those troops. We will not abandon them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    But if the president wants to add to this mission, he is going to have to justify it. And this is new for him because up until now the Republican Congress has given him a blank check with no oversight, no standards, no conditions. And we’ve gone into this situation, which is a war without end, which the American people have rejected.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    SCHIEFFER: Now, let me ask you, and make sure I understand exactly what you are saying because, up until now, Democrats have not been enthusiastic about using the ultimate weapon, and that is to cut off funding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    PELOSI: We won’t do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    SCHIEFFER: But you will not vote any more money to expand the size of the force there?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    Is that what you’re telling us?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    PELOSI: I’m saying two things. We will always support the troops who are there. If the president wants to expand the mission, that’s a conversation he has to have with the Congress of the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    But that’s not a carte blanche, a blank check to him to do whatever he wishes there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    And I want to make a distinction here. Democrats do support increasing the size of the Army by 30,000, the Marines by 10,000 to make sure we’re able to protect the American people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    SCHIEFFER: Enlarging the services overall?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    PELOSI: Overall, in order to protect the American people against any threats to our interests, wherever they may occur. That’s different, though, from adding troops to Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    The president wants to escalate a war where his generals are telling him that the additional troops will not be effective, that they’re easily digestible, to have this number of troops go into Baghdad, and then again, ignoring the strong message of the American people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    SCHIEFFER: So at this point, the Democrats in Congress are not prepared to pay for or to fund an additional number of troops in Iraq?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;    PELOSI: We have to see what the president has to say. It’s not an open-ended commitment anymore. But we will always be there to protect our troops and to support our troops.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116819237603229952/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116819237603229952&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116819237603229952'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116819237603229952'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/no-more-blank-check.html' title='No more blank check'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116819238085665392</id><published>2007-01-07T08:27:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-07T12:53:00.896-05:00</updated><title type='text'>You get what you deserve</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/891648/Kerry11-1-thumb.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/830752/Kerry11-1-thumb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The moronosphere has used this picture to&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;claim no soldiers would eat with John Kerry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;in Iraq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/613922/Kerry.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/808737/Kerry.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Using the magic of Photoshop levels, the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;picture is lightened up and shows Kerry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;talking to at least one person.

Actually, that&#39;s pretty easy. The right blogs could fuck up a free blow job at the Bunny Ranch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has amazed me over the last year is that no one has noticed that the right blogs are shrinking in both power and influence. Because, let&#39;s face it, Malkin writes for shit, Instacracker is a coward who won&#39;t stand behind the ideas he pushes, Red State is filled with children who think Johnny Rebel is funny, and LGF is one poster&#39;s fake anthrax mailing&#39;s arrest from being Stormfront in green.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confederate Yankee. I have to admit, I loved the sheer stupidity of that name. But he too, writes like a consitpated monkey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What I find amusing is that these cretins try to sound so smart, as if they understand things better than you do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why Ass Clown Media&#39;s citizen journalism is so fucking moronic. They have no fucking clue what journalism is, it isn&#39;t fact checking articles from a desk. It isn&#39;t trying to catch the AP in a lie and then jumping up and down about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, journalism is listening to the fact of the situation before making a judgement. As a contest, I&#39;d like to see the last five books Michelle Malkin read. If they had anything to do with objective fact, I&#39;d shit in a litter box.  They enhance their stupidity by have a closed loop of ideas.  They feed on each other&#39;s flimsy ideas and then cheer each other on.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Take that pathetic Jamil Hussein story. The right believes their own bullshit. They think the AP is lying about the war in Iraq. So they concentrate all their tiny brainpower on this one idea, the AP made this guy up to claim six Iraqis were burned alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And missed the point completely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, if the AP reported every gruesome fact they knew about Iraq, you would be vomiting your latte up with the morning news.  Second, as I said to Dave Neiwart, who runs Orcinus, the real story was about the power of the Mahdi Army to go on a rampage and not be stopped.  Not&lt;br /&gt;if people got burnt up, which considering that the average murder in Iraq these days has power tools involved, is hardly in the realm of fantasy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why I was amused/horrified by Girl Reporter Malkin&#39;s trip to Iraq. What the fuck did she think she was going to be up to in the sandbox. A lot of people sneered and said, &quot;oh, she&#39;ll be embedded&quot;. Even so, Iraq is one dangerous fucking place. She wanted to interview people in the street. Well, I want to be a smoke jumper, but without training, it&#39;s pretty much murder/suicide.  Malkin is like one of those idiots who goes to the zoo and tries to pet a panda, only to get dragged in the cage and swatted about like a pull toy.  She thinks the world is made up of people who say tough things and the liberals who are always wrong. In Iraq, the world is made up of people who have guns and those who die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it&#39;s more than that, their blogs, often commentless, are a circle jerk of support. One pinhead says something the other pinheads like and it&#39;s take the pinheads bowling night. Flopping Ears and Klanfederate Moron think this is a good idea, and so do I.  And then they start pestering people with their cretinous ideas. The AP is lying, soldiers hate John Kerry. They create this world because they can&#39;t deal with the real one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The more illogical the right becomes, the more they turn into a circus freak show. While left bloggers raise money and help campaigns, the right makes more and more outlandish claims, which then embarasses them. People only give them credibility out of the reflex that any drivel from the right has to be taken seriously</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116819238085665392/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116819238085665392&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116819238085665392'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116819238085665392'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/you-get-what-you-deserve.html' title='You get what you deserve'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116817495947737201</id><published>2007-01-07T08:02:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-07T08:02:39.500-05:00</updated><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;The Who - Who Are You&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot;

Residents said the once mostly Shiite Muslim hamlet had been racked by sectarian violence that sent many families fleeing. Just two Shiite families remain in what has become a mostly Sunni Muslim community, they said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most denied any knowledge of insurgents. But a detained teenager told troops that the community included a number of fighters who fled on motorcycles through the canal network at the first sound of U.S. helicopters. The boy also said residents received regular visits from masked men on motorcycles who warned them which roads were mined.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;U.S. forces said they had positioned troops to block the insurgents&#39; escape.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The enemy is reacting the way we expected them to, and that will ultimately lead us to triumph and prevail,&quot; squadron commander Lt. Col. Andrew Poppas told superiors in a radio call later Friday night, as a sandstorm closed in and wailing winds buffeted their vehicles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Poppas has said that long-term success depends on the cooperation of the mostly Shiite Iraqi forces, who until recently had refused to patrol the area, which they consider a death trap. He plans to build them a new patrol base in the area.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, U.S. forces say, they must hold the Iraqis back. Iraqi soldiers, used to sprinting through attacks, have expressed frustration at the deliberate approach of the Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We want to kill Wahhabis,&quot; an Iraqi soldier complained to his U.S. counterparts in a joking exchange as they sifted through piles of receipts, letters, identification cards and other documents at a suspect&#39;s residence. He referred to followers of the fundamentalist form of Sunni Islam practiced by Al Qaeda, which has spread in the region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116815829060856744/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116815829060856744&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116815829060856744'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116815829060856744'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/sound-familiar.html' title='Sound familiar?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116815198358539047</id><published>2007-01-07T02:39:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-07T01:43:49.510-05:00</updated><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;The kinks all day and all of the night&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object height=&quot;350&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://youtube.com/v/Q9cgNl5r61I&quot;&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://youtube.com/v/Q9cgNl5r61I&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; height=&quot;350&quot; width=&quot;425&quot;&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does this song not rock?

The fighting along Haifa Street, raging into the night, killed 30 insurgents, and Iraqi soldiers captured eight others, including five Sudanese fighters, Defense Ministry spokesman Mohammed al-Askari said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite fierce ongoing fighting in western Iraq and violence capable of erupting almost anywhere, Baghdad remains the heart of the country&#39;s sectarian conflict. Maliki, in his speech at a morning ceremony honoring the Iraqi army, warned rival political parties against interfering in his plan, which Askari said would start &quot;very soon.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The Baghdad security plan will not offer a safe shelter for outlaws, regardless of their ethnic and political affiliations, and we will punish anyone who hesitates to implement orders because of his ethnic and political background,&quot; Maliki said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maliki&#39;s words appeared intended to counter the perception that the plan would focus on combating Sunni insurgents. An aide to Maliki, Hasan Suneid, a Shiite Muslim lawmaker, told the Associated Press that the Iraqi army would devote 20,000 additional troops to the capital and begin by combating Sunni insurgents in western Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Askari said there would &quot;definitely be more troops&quot; but declined to provide a figure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maliki&#39;s speech provided few details about the tactical or strategic changes guiding the forthcoming effort. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;But his aides described an effort that relies on U.S. troops to combat Sunni insurgents on the outskirts of Baghdad. Those areas are where the Sunni insurgents plan and manufacture the deadly explosives that detonate regularly in the city.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Maliki believes that it is in this ring that the attacks are coming from,&quot; one of his aides said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iraqi forces would target the most violent neighborhoods, and commanders would have a greater degree of autonomy in their assigned sections of the city, Askari said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maliki believes that if the additional troops can effect a decrease in violence over the next two months, then he can negotiate more effectively with Shiite militia leaders in the city and improve his chances of disarming them, his aides said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please. If he can&#39;t control the execution of Saddam, people better realize what this plan &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;really&lt;/span&gt; is, the ethnic cleansing of Baghdad and breaking the Sunni blockade of the city. The US will be assisting Sadr in gaining control of the Baghdad region.  Because someone better realize that the Saddam execution and the Sistani quashing of the coup means the last man standing is the guy with the funny teeth and black turban.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush is so clueless and desperate that he doesn&#39;t realize he&#39;s being coopted into assisting ethnic cleansing. At the end of this, Sadr will be in near total control of most of Iraq&#39;s population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Petraeus should know better. While US troops are getting killed killing Sunnis, Sadr will increase his control over the military and police.  He thinks they&#39;re going to disarm the Mahdi Army? Hell no. The Mahdi Army are the real protectors of the Shia population, they have won support on the ground by saving lives and feeding people. The government is subordinate to Sadr and his supporters, and Sistani made that happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush and his supporters live in a cloud cuckoo land where they don&#39;t understand how they have been manuvered into this mess. Americans troops are being asked to die to establish a Shia theocracy in Iraq.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116815024373892531/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116815024373892531&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116815024373892531'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116815024373892531'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/ethnic-cleansing-in-baghdad.html' title='Ethnic Cleansing in Baghdad'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116814208545286091</id><published>2007-01-07T01:28:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-06T22:54:45.760-05:00</updated><title type='text'>A matter of terms</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/162713/b-24f_r.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/153107/b-24f_r.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The &quot;isolationist&quot; George McGovern flew this&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;over Germany in 1944-45. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/id/2156839/fr/flyout&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Iraqi MistakeWhat was it, exactly?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Jacob Weisberg&lt;br /&gt;Posted Wednesday, Jan. 3, 2007, at 3:44 PM ET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Virtually everyone now agrees that the war in Iraq has been a vast mistake. But what, exactly, was the nature of that mistake? The isolationist left and the realist right—George McGovern and Brent Scowcroft—emphasize that our error was intervening in the absence of overwhelming national interest. At the opposite end of the foreign policy continuum, the neoconservatives contend that invading Iraq was a perfectly good idea undermined by incompetent implementation. In the space between are liberal hawks who originally supported the war and a variety of skeptics who didn&#39;t. They now tend to agree that the war was both a mistake in theory and a disaster in execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What makes this backward-looking conversation more than academic is its implications for American foreign policy beyond Iraq. The U.S. defeat in Vietnam left a disinclination to use military force that lasted many years. &quot;By God, we&#39;ve kicked the Vietnam syndrome once and for all,&quot; the first President Bush declared at the height of his seeming Gulf War triumph in 1991. And I&#39;ve brought it roaring back, his son might well respond.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But if the invasion of Iraq is mainly a case of bungled execution—a war that, whether justified or not in principle, could have left behind a peaceful, functioning Iraqi state at a tolerable cost—then the isolationist/realist lesson is the wrong one to draw.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I love when some assclown like Lord Weisberg questions someone like George McGovern, who&#39;s personal courage is beyond question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But here&#39;s a brief explaination of why the Iraq war failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1)Iraq is not an artificial state, but one with distinct interest groups. Saddam spent much of his time protecting himself from, and catering to them. Some people, the Talibanis, the Sadrs, were never happy, but others were. If you try to fracture Iraq, no state will be strong enough to survive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Exiles sold their fantasies of being conquering heroes and instead were met with contempt from the survivors of Saddam. They were weaker compared to the prevailing forces, the Sunni shieks, B&#39;aathists, Sadrists and Sistani. All would define what would happen in Iraq far more than any exile&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3) There were two different plans for Iraq, both doomed to fail. The first was to hand the country over to Chalabi, which would have resulted in anarchy within days, or to establish a colonial regime. Since the infighting was so intense, neither plan was fully hatched until Viceroy Bremer was sent to bring order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4)The Bush Administration had no respect for the complications of establishing order in a colony, so they sent the young and untrained to run Iraq. Few ever saw what they were supposed to be changing. The Americans neither trusted nor respected the Iraqis they were supposed to serve. Having no training in foreign service matters, they were more hinderance than help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5)Combat never stopped. The US was unable to ever establish order in the streets of Baghdad, which meant their word was useless. Soon, those who worked with the Americans became targets. The Iraqis had a much better sense of how to manipulate the Americans than vice versa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6) Despite all their blather, few people realized what this war was quickly turning into. They talked about Al Qaeda and dead enders, but in less than a year, the Shia were running major attacks on them. Only Sistani&#39;s intervention prevented a full scale war on the Americans. The US was falling into the trap of fighting a colonial war, while all the warbloggers talked about Islamofascism. While they were attacking Cindy Sheehan, they forgot one thing: her son was killed by the Sadrists.  Which went against the narrative we had been fed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7) By the time the Iraqis finally had elections, what you had was all the factions, excluding the Sunnis, in parliment, and they wanted revenge.  The government forces quickly fell under the spell of various militias and while we trained them, they didn&#39;t improve their effectiveness.  But the Mahdi Army did. SCIRI did, the guerrillas in Anbar Province did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While there was a great deal of rhetoric about a united Iraq, the US was playing the game of divide and conquer. Their trump move was to install Hakim&#39;s puppet over Maliki. Until Sistani said no, and left the power in the hands of Sadr. The exact opposite of their plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#39;t bungled execution.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No Iraqi government not controlled by the Sadrists could have survived. Because they are the majority. They had no interest in sharing anything or a democratic government. Because this is a colonial war, and no structure set up by the US would have had any credibility.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116814208545286091/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116814208545286091&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116814208545286091'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116814208545286091'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/matter-of-terms.html' title='A matter of terms'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116814303741338045</id><published>2007-01-07T01:06:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-07T01:11:57.353-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The end of the road</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/07/world/07prexy.xlarge1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/07/world/07prexy.xlarge1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mohammed Jalil/European Pressphoto Agency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Iraqis inspected the wreckage after a car bomb &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;exploded in Baghdad Saturday.

SANGER&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 7, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 — President Bush’s new Iraq strategy calls for a rapid influx of forces that could add as many as 20,000 American combat troops to Baghdad, supplemented with a jobs program costing as much as $1 billion intended to employ Iraqis in projects including painting schools and cleaning streets, according to American officials who are piecing together the last parts of the initiative.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American officials said Iraq’s prime minister, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, formally agreed in a long teleconference on Thursday with Mr. Bush to match the American troop increase, made up of five combat brigades that would go in at a rate of roughly one a month, by sending three more Iraqi brigades to Baghdad over the next month and a half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nonetheless, even in outlining the plan, some American officials acknowledged deep skepticism about whether the new plan could succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;They said two-thirds of the promised Iraqi force would consist of Kurdish pesh merga units to be sent from northern Iraq, and they said some doubts remained about whether they would show up in Baghdad and were truly committed to quelling sectarian fighting.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The call for an increase in troops would also put Mr. Bush in direct confrontation with the leaders of the new Democratic Congress, who said in a letter to the president on Friday that the United States should move instead toward a phased withdrawal of American troops, to begin in the next four months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Bush is expected to make the plan public in coming days, probably in a speech to the country on Wednesday that will cast the initiative as a joint effort by the United States and Iraq to reclaim control of Baghdad neighborhoods racked by sectarian violence. Officials said Mr. Bush was likely to be vague on the question of how long the additional American forces would remain on the streets of Baghdad. But they said American planners intended for the push to last for less than a year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A crucial element of the plan would include more than doubling the State Department’s reconstruction efforts throughout the country, an initiative intended by the administration to signal that the new strategy would emphasize rebuilding as much as fighting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But previous American reconstruction efforts in Iraq have failed to translate into support from the Iraqi population, and some Republicans as well as the new Democratic leadership in Congress have questioned if a troop increase would do more than postpone the inevitable and precarious moment when Iraqi forces have to stand on their own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congress has the power to halt the increases by cutting off money for Mr. Bush’s proposals. But some Democrats are torn about whether to press ahead with such a move for fear that it will appear that they are not supporting the troops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Mr. Bush gives his speech, he will cast much of the program as an effort to bolster Iraq’s efforts to take command over their own forces and territory, the American officials said. He will express confidence that Mr. Maliki is committed to bringing under control both the Sunni-led insurgency and the Shiite militias that have emerged as the source of most of the violence. Mr. Maliki picked up those themes in a speech in Baghdad on Saturday in which he said that multinational troops would support an Iraqi effort to secure the capital.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This plan is doomed.

In Baghdad fighting the Mahdi Army?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116814303741338045/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116814303741338045&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116814303741338045'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116814303741338045'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/end-of-road.html' title='The end of the road'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116814257895052165</id><published>2007-01-07T01:01:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-06T23:03:21.676-05:00</updated><title type='text'>They make this up, Michelle?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/966873/noose.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/759328/noose.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/world/middleeast/07iraq.html&quot;&gt; 30 Dead in Baghdad Clash; Bodies Hanged on Lampposts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By MARC SANTORA&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 7, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan. 6 — A fierce clash left at least 30 people dead in central Baghdad late Saturday night as Iraqi Army forces fought with gunmen in an area where several residents had been killed and their bodies hanged from street lampposts, the Iraqi military said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fighting took place in the neighborhood around Haifa Street, a mostly Sunni Arab enclave with a small Shiite population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A spokesman for the Defense Ministry, Muhammad al-Askari, said that an Iraqi Army unit had gone into the area after receiving reports that Sunni fighters had set up a fake security checkpoint and were taking Shiites aside and shooting them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodies of many of those killed at the roadblock were then hanged from the lampposts, Mr. Askari said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116814257895052165/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116814257895052165&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116814257895052165'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116814257895052165'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/they-make-this-up-michelle.html' title='They make this up, Michelle?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116805895119542148</id><published>2007-01-06T01:31:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-05T23:49:11.816-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Casualities and combat</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/852378/nijmegen%20bridge.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/92379/nijmegen%20bridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Nijmegen Bridge, 2006&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the most frustrating arguments I have heard in discussing Iraq is the idea that units in WWII and Korea took more casualities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s the wrong comparison for many reasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s discuss the obvious, the scale of war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the 2/502 went to seize the Nijmegen bridge on September 21, 1944, nearly a thousand men crossed the Waal River in canvas boats, they faced dug in SS troops over an open bank.

She is the coauthor, with Joseph Stiglitz, of the report, &quot;The Economic Cost of the Iraq War: An Appraisal&lt;br /&gt;  January 5, 2007  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;       THE NEW YEAR brought with it the 3,000th American death in Iraq. But what&#39;s equally alarming — and far less well known — is that for every fatality in Iraq, there are 16 injuries. That&#39;s an unprecedented casualty level. In the Vietnam and Korean wars, by contrast, there were fewer than three people wounded for each fatality. In World Wars I and II, there were less than two.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That means we now have more than 50,000 wounded Iraq war soldiers. In one sense, this reflects positive change: Better medical care and stronger body armor are enabling many more soldiers to survive injuries that might have led, in earlier generations, to death. But like so much else about this war, the Bush administration failed to foresee what it would mean, failed to plan for the growing tide of veterans who would be in urgent need of medical and disability care. The result is that as the Iraq war approaches its fourth anniversary, the Department of Veterans Affairs is buckling under a growing volume of disability claims and rising demand for medical attention.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So far, more than 200,000 veterans from Iraq and Afghanistan have been treated at VA medical facilities — three times what the VA projected, according to a Government Accountability Office analysis. More than one-third of them have been diagnosed with mental health conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder, acute depression and substance abuse. Thousands more have crippling disabilities such as brain or spinal injuries. In each of the last two years, the VA has underestimated the number of veterans who would seek help and the cost of treating them — forcing it to go cap in hand to Congress for billions of dollars in emergency funding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The VA system has a reputation for high-quality care, but waiting lists to see a doctor at some facilities now run as long as several months. Shortages are particularly acute in mental health care. Dr. Frances Murphy, the VA&#39;s deputy undersecretary for health, recently wrote that some VA clinics do not provide mental health or substance abuse care, or if they do, &quot;waiting lists render that care virtually inaccessible.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;What the wingnuts obscure is the tremendous number of wounded from Iraq. The US has nearly 30000 casualites from a war where for most of that time, no single resistance group was larger than a thousand men. Now, with various factions of the Mahdi Army up to 60,000 men, the US Army is facing a massive force on near equal terms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that a few thousand more troops will matter is insane.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116805895119542148/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116805895119542148&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116805895119542148'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116805895119542148'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/casualities-and-combat.html' title='Casualities and combat'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116806439847405323</id><published>2007-01-06T01:19:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-06T01:19:58.510-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Shut up, shut up</title><content type='html'>&lt;h2&gt;         &lt;a class=&quot;post-title&quot; href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/01/05/late-nite-fdl-spocko-vs-the-rat/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent Link to Late Nite FDL: Spocko vs. The Rat&quot;&gt;           Late Nite FDL: Spocko vs. The Rat        &lt;/a&gt;       &lt;/h2&gt;          &lt;div class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;By: &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/index.php?author=35&quot;&gt;TRex&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;             &lt;p&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;image6463&quot; src=&quot;http://static.firedoglake.com/2007/01/elrato.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;el rato&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; width=&quot;228&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evenin&#39;, fellow firedogs!  Tonight I&#39;m going to attempt to get us all up to speed about a situation that I suspect we&#39;re going to be hearing a lot about in the near future.  This story was brought to my attention by &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogintegrityblogspotcom.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;¡El Gato Negro!&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where to begin?  First we&#39;ll go to A. J. Kandy, who blogs at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kingmarketing.ca/weblogs/ajkandy/archives/2007/01/bad_brand_stewa.html&quot;&gt;King Marketing&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;ABC&lt;/span&gt;/Disney operates a US-wide network of radio stations and affiliates. One of these affiliates, San Francisco’s &lt;span class=&quot;caps&quot;&gt;KSFO, &lt;/span&gt;is a die-hard right-wing talk shop whose rabidly eliminationist hosts have publicly endorsed (if not outright revelled in) torture and engaged in hate speech of all stripes. However, the station is sold to its advertisers as a “Disney” station, with all the connotations of family-friendliness that entails.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blogintegrityblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-am-spocko.html&quot;&gt;Self-described “fifth-tier blogger” Spocko decided to “out” KSFO&lt;/a&gt; to its national advertisers with a polite letter-writing campaign, and by exposing their hate speech on his blog with short audio clips and transcripts (which falls under the Fair Use statutes.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;This, of course, is what we call citizen action, and most of us know the drill by now.  We write to advertisers and once in a blue moon, they write us back, pat us on the head and tell us that they&#39;ll take our suggestion under advisement, then go on their merry way without changing a thing.  This was not the case, however, with Spocko.  From &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogintegrityblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-am-spocko.html&quot;&gt;a guest post at BlogIntegrity&lt;/a&gt;, Spocko himself can tell us what happened next:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-December I got confirmation that a major national advertiser, VISA, pulled their ads from the Melanie Morgan and Lee Rogers show, based on listening to audio clips I provided them. I also think that FedEx, AT&amp;T and Kaiser are considering pulling their ads. Visa isn’t the first advertiser who has left KSFO, multiple advertisers have left the station, especially from the Brian Sussman show. In July of this year when KSFO lost MasterCard as an advertiser someone from KSFO “outed” me on a counter-blog (which I won’t link to). This same person has also threatened me with local and federal criminal action for using the audio (which I clearly used under the fair use portion of copyright law). And because they have suggested violence toward me (in addition to talking about suing me &quot;for everything I have”) I have chosen to remain anonymous.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; As Thers has said,&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Hooray, for &lt;a href=&quot;http://whiskeyfire.typepad.com/whiskey_fire/&quot;&gt;Thers&lt;/a&gt;!!  Oh, uh, ahem.  Sorry.  You were saying, Spocko? &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;95 percent of blog fights don’t mean anything, but I think this one does since KSFO is using the full weight and force of an ABC/Disney lawyer and copyright law against a private citizen blogger. I dared to use the audio content in question for nonprofit educational purposes (I don’t even have ads on my blog!), and thus under the protection of the Fair Use Doctrine set forth in Section 107 of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C.§107.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now we go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://publications.mediapost.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=53428&quot;&gt;Online Media Daily&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;articleText&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;IN THE LATEST SKIRMISH BETWEEN &lt;/span&gt;big media and a blogger, The Walt Disney Company has succeeded in shutting down the Web site &quot;Spocko&#39;s Brain.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;articleText&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;articleText&quot;&gt;On the site, blogger and media critic &quot;Spocko&quot; took issue with on-air comments made by right-wing talk show hosts at Bay Area ABC affiliate radio station KSFO. He posted audio files of hosts&#39; comments on his Web site, and also began a letter-writing campaign that, he says, resulted in advertisers fleeing the station.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;articleText&quot;&gt;But Tuesday, Spocko&#39;s Internet service provider, 1&amp;1 Internet, pulled the plug on the blog–a move prompted by a Dec. 22 cease-and-desist letter from ABC Radio claiming that material on Spocko&#39;s Brain violated Disney&#39;s copyright.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;articleText&quot;&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;articleText&quot;&gt;And that&#39;s where things stand right now.  Many of us are now familiar with ABC/Disney&#39;s strong-arm fascism-in-mouse-ears tactics from the &quot;Path to 9/11&quot; debacle earlier this year.  Here&#39;s what you can do to help our fellow blogger, Spocko:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;articleText&quot;&gt;1. The KSFO hate clips are &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogintegrityblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2007/01/ksfos-eliminationist-tendencies-caught.html&quot;&gt;all up at Online BlogIntegrity&lt;/a&gt;.  Collect &#39;em all.  Share with your friends.  Spread them around.  It&#39;s a veritable cornucopia of Right Wing Hate Speech.  (Listen at your own risk.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class=&quot;articleText&quot;&gt;2. Go &lt;a href=&quot;http://blogintegrityblogspotcom.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-am-spocko.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and scroll down to &quot;What Can You Do?&quot; and follow the instructions.  Spocko has provided us with a step-by-step plan to alert the blogging world, the MSM (if they&#39;ll listen), and KSFO&#39;s advertisers to the current situation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I urge you all to get involved.  This is an example of how we can effectively fight the tide of hateful bile that pollutes our airwaves and rots the brains of millions of overly credulous talk-radio listeners.  We, of course, support the wingnuts&#39; right to say whatever they want to say, but they must be prepared to face the real-world consequences of stoking the fires of ethnic, political, and religious hatred.  If that means losing the support of their advertisers and cutting into their six-figure salaries, well, then, hurrah!  We win.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Thank you and good night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116806439847405323/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116806439847405323&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116806439847405323'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116806439847405323'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/shut-up-shut-up.html' title='Shut up, shut up'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116805954846101566</id><published>2007-01-06T00:56:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-05T23:59:08.486-05:00</updated><title type='text'>What&#39;s next for Apple?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://technology.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1984014,00.html&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://image.guardian.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2006/09/12/jobs372ready.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://technology.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1984014,00.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For my next trick ... devotees wait to see what Steve Jobs has up his sleeve&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;iPod? iPhone? iTV? Apple&#39;s guru will try to dazzle fans and rivals in showcase event&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bobbie Johnson, technology correspondent in Las Vegas&lt;br /&gt;Saturday January 6, 2007&lt;br /&gt;The Guardian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What exactly does Steve Jobs, the Apple chief executive, have up his sleeve? Is it a phone? Another iPod? Or something else entirely? That is the billion-dollar question as the technology industry gears up for one of its biggest weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Apple has media pundits and bloggers frenzied with speculation over what products it might be preparing to unveil. Many are convinced that the long-awaited iPhone - a mobile handset that incorporates iPod functions and design - could be on the menu when Mr Jobs takes to the stage at his annual showcase in San Francisco next Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Article continues&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Apple waited several years to enter the MP3 market,&quot; says Gene Munster, an analyst with the investment bank Piper Jaffray, who believes that an iPhone is imminent. &quot;We believe the company is well-positioned to enter the phone market now that early music-enabled handsets have tested the waters.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Jobs&#39;s speeches have become a must-see event in the technology industry, with the crowd - largely comprised of adoring followers - screaming and whooping their way throughout. Even the most minor announcements are met with a mania that leaves his strait-laced rivals baffled. Despite such cultish devotion, the Apple phone has been a rumour for so long that it has developed into a standing joke. However, technology experts remain convinced that it is a necessary step if the company wishes to convert its iconic status into a truly global force.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite the iPod&#39;s success - so extensive that its designer, Jonathan Ive, has just been granted a place in Who&#39;s Who - few think it is infallible. Mobile companies such as Nokia and Sony Ericsson have started putting iPod-like capabilities into their phones. And with sales of mobiles expected to pass 1bn in 2007, the threat is growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confident&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I am 99% confident we will see an Apple phone, with enhanced music capabilities and maybe a few computing features such as email,&quot; David Sobotta, a former manager at the company, wrote in the Guardian this week. &quot;The mobile phone market is almost perfect for Apple strategy.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other suggestions include iPod enhancements such as a touch-sensitive screen or the ability to connect to the internet, as well as the final launch of a television set-top box codenamed &quot;iTV&quot;. This device could record TV shows and download programmes from the internet but has yet to materialise on the high street after being previewed last year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if Apple unveils something substantial next week it will still have to compete with a host of rivals. Monday marks the start of one of the most frenzied periods in the technology calendar, with Apple&#39;s exhibition vying against the massive Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Considered one of the world&#39;s premier showcases for new technology, CES features a large number of heavy hitters ready to outpunch their rivals with big announcements.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116805954846101566/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116805954846101566&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116805954846101566'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116805954846101566'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/whats-next-for-apple.html' title='What&#39;s next for Apple?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116805352157737643</id><published>2007-01-06T00:43:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-05T22:18:41.596-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Fag loving speaker ruins America</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/34051/Pelosi%20Banner2_0001.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/916362/Pelosi%20Banner2_0001.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s play a game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s imagine the worst things that the right will say about Speaker Pelosi and get ahead of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Only catch, you have to take the voice of a famous right wing asshole&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll start with Focus on the Family&#39;s Jim Dobson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Nancy Pelosi has a long record of supporting the homosexual agenda and promoting an attack on marriage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Her San Francisco agenda may soon become the nation&#39;s as she sponsors bills to support abortion, stem cell research and gay rights.

Roy Blunt of Missouri, was to hand his successor, Democratic Rep. James Clyburn of South Carolina, an actual whip that had been on display in Blunt&#39;s leadership office at the U.S. Capitol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But racial overtones apparently undermined the plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As camera flashes popped and video recorders whirled Thursday, Clyburn, a 66-year-old African-American from the South, did not receive the whip from Blunt, a 56-year-old white man from a border state.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, Clyburn was given the whip by former Rep. William Gray of Philadelphia, who in 1989 became the first black House majority whip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blunt&#39;s spokeswoman, Jessica Boulanger, said it was her understanding that Gray wanted to give Clyburn a whip as a gift, &quot;but you&#39;d have to check with Mr. Clyburn&#39;s office.&quot; A Dec. 22 press release from Clyburn&#39;s office said Blunt would be presenting the whip to Clyburn. Clyburn, now the second African-American to hold the House&#39;s No. 3 post, declined repeated requests Thursday to explain why the ceremony was changed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ronald Walters, a black political science professor at the University of Maryland, said he had little doubt that racial sensitivity prompted the decision to have Clyburn receive the whip from a fellow African-American instead of from a white man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What it tells us is that race is still a very salient and touchy and dangerous issue to politicians,&quot; Walters said. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116805391033869743/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116805391033869743&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116805391033869743'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116805391033869743'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/no-whips-from-whitey.html' title='No whips from whitey'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116805257569100199</id><published>2007-01-06T00:09:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-05T22:04:57.883-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Asshole</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/571485/wtc.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/63281/wtc.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/01/05/cnn-anchor-it-might-not_n_37897.html?source=widget&quot;&gt; CNN Anchor: &quot;It Might Not Be Bad&quot; If I Hurricane Were To &quot;Clean The Streets Out&quot; In NYC...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;CNN   |  Posted January 5, 2007 08:42 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From mediamatters.org&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BECK: OK. Yesterday and when I heard the final -- the final words of the hurricane chief, and he said, you know, this is coming, I thought exactly of the words that I read about, starting I think in the 1950s, the warnings in New Orleans, &quot;It`s coming, it`s coming, reinforce the walls&quot; and nobody did anything about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And now here we are rebuilding the wall to the exact same level as it was before. I mean, it`s going to happen again in New Orleans, isn`t it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LANDSEA: Well, New Orleans is very vulnerable. So is Houston. So is Tampa. So it Miami, even New York. And so it`s not a matter if you`ll have a strong hurricane strike those areas; it`s a matter of when.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BECK: What is the city that you`re most concerned about? What`s the one that you say, this is it? This is ground zero?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LANDSEA: It could be Tampa. Extremely vulnerable, low lying, a big bay. A hurricane will funnel the water in and flood the entire city.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BECK: Right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LANDSEA: New York is extremely vulnerable, too, if a hurricane strikes just west of them and funnels all that water just north along Long Island into the city itself. They could have 20 to 25 feet of storm surge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BECK: Actually, that would clean the streets out. It might not be bad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Osama tried, you filthy motherfucker.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116805257569100199/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116805257569100199&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116805257569100199'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116805257569100199'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/asshole.html' title='Asshole'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116805219117369673</id><published>2007-01-06T00:09:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-05T21:56:31.216-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Praising scumbags</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/765346/money.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/785793/money.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.tpmmuckraker.com/archives/002288.php&quot;&gt; Hail The Conquering Hero&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Paul Kiel - January 5, 2007, 11:29 AM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From CNN:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;    On the same day that the 110th Democratic-led Congress convenes with a plan to immediately pass lobbyist and ethics reforms, the Congressional Black Caucus Thursday gave a standing ovation to Rep.

Last year, James Gartner made a very well-thought-of film called Glory Road, in which a ragtag group of feisty young black men are whipped into shape by a white guy played by an actor most famous for helping his fellow shipwreckees escape from the capsized ocean liner in Poseidon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now Zwick himself is back with a film in which a feisty but hapless black guy is whipped into shape by a white guy played by an actor who first achieved fame by playing a mentally handicapped boy in What&#39;s Eating Gilbert Grape? If there is anything black people the world over have learned from Hollywood - and there isn&#39;t a whole lot - it&#39;s that no matter how bleak the situation seems, they can always rely on some resourceful, charismatic and, in some instances, shapely white person to bail them out.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Zwick film in question is the exciting but characteristically idiotic Blood Diamond, in which Leonardo DiCaprio plays a ruthless Rhodesian smuggler who specialises in spiriting precious stones out of war-torn nations whose diamonds the G8 nations have promised not to purchase, as the profits are invariably used to do very bad things. They are called &quot;conflict diamonds&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite Connolly&#39;s beatific stature as the White Journalist Who Cares - and Cares Deeply - she gradually finds her role as the anointed one filched from right under her by the morally recrudescent DiCaprio. For, as the film proceeds, and as more and more horrible black rebels kill off horrible black soldiers representing the horrible black regime - every black person in the film is either a victim or a monster - DiCaprio gradually comes to realise that there are more important things in life than money, that ebony needs ivory, that diamonds are not forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zwick would thus have us believe that in a society ravaged by a murderous civil war, where black children are routinely kidnapped and induced to murder other black children, after being shot up with heroin purchased with conflict diamonds from horrible white people from out of town, the man who will ultimately bring the villains to justice is a formally depraved Rhodesian mercenary who now prefers justice and racial harmony to wealth. Hmmm, say I to Mr Zwick. Hmmm!&lt;br /&gt;...........................&lt;br /&gt;The template for the Up With Caucasians! film was established in 1962 with the release of Robert Mulligan&#39;s preposterously overrated To Kill a Mockingbird. Based on a beloved, fabulously successful, thoroughly absurd novel by Harper Lee, who never wrote another book, To Kill a Mockingbird tells the story of two white children living in the Deep South in the 1930s who gradually come to realise what a heroic figure their father cuts after he courageously defends a black man accused of raping a white woman.&lt;br /&gt;.........................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the spirit that animates films as varied as Mississippi Burning, where Gene Hackman plays a racist FBI agent who helps bring murderous Klansmen to justice, and A Time to Die, a typically knuckleheaded Joel Schumacher offering starring Matthew McConaughey and Sandra Bullock as crusading white folks who will do anything to ensure that Samuel L Jackson gets justice in the Deep South. For that matter, it is the theme of Glory Road, a film about an all-black basketball team that beat an all-white basketball team for the 1965 collegiate basketball championship in a truly legendary, watershed contest that changed American society forever, and whose star is the very white Josh Lucas, who plays the black athletes&#39; coach. This is like making a movie about heavyweight boxers in the late 20th century where the champion is a short white guy from south Philadelphia. Who would buy a premise like that?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The difference between Glory and most of these other movies is that it was historically accurate.&lt;br /&gt;But in most cases, including the newly released Freedom Writers, the missonary effect is what we see.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The white comes into a savage land and tames the natives. The idea that minorities don&#39;t need taming doesn&#39;t sell in Hollywood.  There is always a white Bwana to save the day and change the negroes from savages into humans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minorities are rarely allowed to be the heroes of their own stories.  There always seems to be the need for a white savior so the audience can &quot;relate&quot;, as if blacks are incompetent and need to be patronized. Which is why HK films are so popular in America. When Chow Yun Fat or Jackie Chan is on the screen or Jet Li, we don&#39;t need some white nanny to save the day. They save the day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These movies reflect a subtle brainwashing which suggests that blacks cannot perform like whites or without white guidence. Oddly enough, this doesn&#39;t seem to be the case on American TV, where strong black characters are the stars of shows like the Unit and Gray&#39;s Anatomy, and have prominent roles on shows like 24 and Law and Order.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116802265189008058/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116802265189008058&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116802265189008058'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116802265189008058'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/save-me-bwana.html' title='Save me, Bwana'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116798312999701446</id><published>2007-01-05T02:12:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-05T02:45:30.110-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Books to read so you won&#39;t sound like a stupid warblogger</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

Casey Jr., whose &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;plan for troop reductions has faltered.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/05/world/middleeast/05military.html?hp&amp;ex=1168059600&amp;amp;en=b4d8f52e64339832&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt;Bush to Name a New General to Oversee Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By MICHAEL R. GORDON and THOM SHANKER&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 5, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON, Jan. 4 — President Bush has decided to name Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus as the top American military commander in Iraq, part of a broad revamping of the military team that will carry out the administration’s new Iraq strategy, administration officials said Thursday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the promotion of General Petraeus, who will replace Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the choice to succeed Gen. John P. Abizaid as the head of the Central Command is expected to be Adm. William J. Fallon, who is the top American military officer in the Pacific, officials said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The changes are being made as the White House is considering an option to increase American combat power in Baghdad by five brigades as well as adding two battalions of reinforcements to the volatile province of Anbar in western Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Bush, who said Thursday that he would present details of his overall strategy for Iraq next week, and several top aides held a video teleconference on Thursday, speaking with Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki of Iraq and his top deputies about plans to add forces in the capital and other matters. The session lasted roughly an hour and 45 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I said that ‘You show the will, we will help you,’ ” Mr. Bush told reporters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Echoing the comments of both military and political advisers in recent weeks, he added, “One thing is for certain: I will want to make sure that the mission is clear and specific and can be accomplished.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senior administration officials said that the choice of General Petraeus was part of a broader effort to change almost all of the top American officials in Iraq as Mr. Bush changes his strategy there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“The idea is to put the whole new team in at roughly the same time, and send some clear messages that we are trying a new approach,” a senior administration official said Thursday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the military changes, Mr. Bush intends to appoint the ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad, as the new United States ambassador to the United Nations, a senior administration official said Thursday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It was clearly time to move the players around on the field,” said the senior official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because Mr. Bush had yet to announce the changes. “This helps the president to make the case that this is a fresh start.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Admiral Fallon would be the first Navy officer to serve as the senior officer of the Central Command, which is managing simultaneous ground wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Admiral Fallon is regarded within the military as one of its stronger regional combat commanders, and his possible appointment also reflects a greater emphasis on countering Iranian power, a mission that relies heavily on naval forces and combat airpower to project American influence in the Persian Gulf.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Petraeus, who is now the head of the Army’s Combined Arms Center at Fort Leavenworth, Kan., helped oversee the drafting of the military’s comprehensive new manual on counterinsurgency. He has served two previous tours in Iraq, and some former officers say he sees the need for additional troops in Baghdad.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But even as commander of the 101, by the time of the end of his stay in Mosul, his units were taking losses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dave Petreus talks a great game, but has failed repeatedly in Iraq. His second tour, was, in effect, a diaster. The Iraqi Army is now factionalized and useless. The officers still think they&#39;re fighting Iranians. Many of the troops have other loyalties. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He&#39;s gonna play Jacques Massu in Baghdad and fail because the Mahdi Army now runs most of the city and the government. The government and most of the police and Army are now loyal to Sadr, as the execution of Saddam shows.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116797916235120546/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116797916235120546&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116797916235120546'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116797916235120546'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/failure-in-iraq.html' title='Failure in Iraq'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116798084478185516</id><published>2007-01-05T01:58:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-05T02:07:26.273-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The real New York</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/05/nyregion/600_life.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/05/nyregion/600_life.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Syshe Autrey, 4, got a laugh as she aimed five fingers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;toward Mayor Michael R.

Past honorees have included Gen. Douglas MacArthur, Martin Luther King Jr., Muhammad Ali and Willie Mays. The last recipient was Housing Authority employee Felix Vasquez, who caught a baby thrown from a burning building in 2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Autrey is &quot;a man who makes us all proud to be New Yorkers,&quot; said the mayor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After giving the mayor thanks and a bear hug, Autrey recounted the details of the risky rescue for the media gathered at City Hall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hollopeter, a student at the New York Film Academy, was at the subway station at 137th Street/City College when he suffered a seizure and fell onto the tracks just as a train was approaching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Autrey was standing on the platform with his daughters and scores of other subway riders when he saw Hollopeter convulsing on the tracks. As he watched, he thought: &quot;I&#39;m the only one to do it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He eyed the trough between the rails before jumping on top of the teenager, Autrey said, and relied on his experience as a construction worker used to &quot;confined spaces&quot; to calculate - in split seconds - that &quot;maybe we have enough clearance.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before jumping, he said he made sure his daughters were OK and asked two women to hold their hands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The southbound train grazed the top of his hat. He said he and Hollopeter remained there for 20 minutes while transit workers shut off the third rail.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/05/nyregion/05baby.html&quot;&gt; this:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two men first saw the baby from across the Bronx street, dangling from a fire escape four stories above the sidewalk. His grip was growing weaker by the second. The two men saw only one choice: run over and try to catch him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They positioned themselves below, arms out. The little boy fell. He glanced off a branch of a tree that was brushing against the fire escape. Then he bounced off the chest of one of the men, who was knocked off balance and could not grab him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But he landed safely in the arms of the other man, who managed to hold on tight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so yesterday, the two men — longtime friends who had been looking over a used Honda that one was thinking of selling and the other was thinking of buying — became the second and third good Samaritans of the new year, not even a week old. The rescue came two days after another New Yorker flung himself onto the subway tracks to save a 20-year-old film student who had fallen from the platform.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is a week of heroes here in New York,” Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said later yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two men — Julio Gonzalez, 43, a mechanic who lives in the neighborhood, and Pedro Nevarez, 40, of Corona, Queens — insisted that they had just done the obvious thing. As Mr. Nevarez, who has a 19-year-old foster son, put it: “I’m not a hero. I did what any other father would do. When you’re a father, you would do this whether it’s your child or not.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;I think Keith Olbermann summed it up best: &quot;If you lost a heel, fuggetaboutit. But when it&#39;s something big, call a New Yorker.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think the thing people mistake about New York is the myth of rudeness. Sure, people get brushed aside, but get in real trouble, have a real problem and New Yorkers step up.  This isn&#39;t the first time someone stepped up in a moment of crisis, but the story is remarkable.

Jamil Hussein, said in an interview that Hussein is an officer assigned to the Khadra police station, as had been reported by The Associated Press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This should explain, even to the idiots, why Hussein didn&#39;t &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mypetjawa.mu.nu/archives/185809.php&quot;&gt;come forward &lt;/a&gt;to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.floppingaces.net/jamil-hussein-story/&quot;&gt;clear his name&lt;/a&gt;,&quot; pretty nicely, doesn&#39;t it?

They can&#39;t organize.  They can&#39;t even acknowledge that they&#39;ve been beating a dead story into the ground because like their fearless leader, they equate admitting they are wrong with failure. Yet they are wrong, almost all the time and about almost everything.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Wrong wrong wrong.  You were wrong, Malkin, wrong.  Dead wrong.  Now please STFU and stay in your bunker before you and the wingnut nob-sucking Eason Jordan get any American servicemen killed guarding your skanky ass in your narcissistic vanity trip, because your desire to hoover up all the wingnut welfare in sight spreading the delusional stories of a desperate and sinking administration is truly not worth it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update:&lt;/strong&gt;  If you know anyone in Iraq who perchance encounters the dynamic duo, the General is going to &lt;a href=&quot;http://patriotboy.blogspot.com/2006_12_31_patriotboy_archive.html#116787775078568302&quot;&gt;keep tabs&lt;/a&gt;  on &quot;Floppy&quot; and &quot;Our Lady of the Concentration Camps.&quot; You just &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; there are going to be some dilly stories to be had, and the General is just the fellow to collect them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update II&lt;/strong&gt;: Even &lt;em&gt;I &lt;/em&gt;don&#39;t want her to go over there and get her ass shot up, so in the spirit of blogger comity I extend to that shreiking ding-dong a &lt;a href=&quot;http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/time-to-pray.html&quot;&gt;Steve Gilliard Reality Check&lt;/a&gt;.

Well, like so many things about the Vietnam War, it&#39;s not exactly what it seems. In fact, the photo is not of the embassy at all; the helicopter was actually on the roof of an apartment building in downtown Saigon where senior Central Intelligence Agency employees were housed&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&gt;..........&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you looked north from the office balcony, toward the cathedral, about four blocks from us, on the corner of Tu Do and Gia Long, you could see a building called the Pittman Apartments, where we knew the C.I.A. station chief and many of his officers lived. Several weeks earlier the roof of the elevator shaft had been reinforced with steel plate so that it would be able to take the weight of a helicopter. A makeshift wooden ladder now ran from the lower roof to the top of the shaft. Around 2:30 in the afternoon, while I was working in the darkroom, I suddenly heard Bert Okuley shout, &quot;Van Es, get out here, there&#39;s a chopper on that roof!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I grabbed my camera and the longest lens left in the office - it was only 300 millimeters, but it would have to do - and dashed to the balcony. Looking at the Pittman Apartments, I could see 20 or 30 people on the roof, climbing the ladder to an Air America Huey helicopter. At the top of the ladder stood an American in civilian clothes, pulling people up and shoving them inside.&lt;br /&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;    Of course, there was no possibility that all the people on the roof could get into the helicopter, and it took off with 12 or 14 on board. (The recommended maximum for that model was eight.) Those left on the roof waited for hours, hoping for more helicopters to arrive. To no avail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After shooting about 10 frames, I went back to the darkroom to process the film and get a print ready for the regular 5 p.m. transmission to Tokyo from Saigon&#39;s telegraph office. In those days, pictures were transmitted via radio signals, which at the receiving end were translated back into an image. A 5-inch-by-7-inch black-and-white print with a short caption took 12 minutes to send.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, let me get this: a picture of CIA officers and Air America pilots desperately trying to save their Vietnamese staff is supposed to be some kind of cheap joke? The fact that the people on there were in fear of their lives and the pilots were taking insane risks means nothing to these chairborne cowards.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116796671905740322/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116796671905740322&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116796671905740322'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116796671905740322'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/rightwing-geldings-mock-cia.html' title='Rightwing Geldings mock CIA'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116796530964094811</id><published>2007-01-05T01:31:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-04T21:48:29.896-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Not one more</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/842619/boyda.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/96729/boyda.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Rep.

The existence of Jamil Hussein had been hotly disputed by conservative bloggers, some Iraqi officials and the U.S. military in recent weeks.&lt;br /&gt;*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD (AP) -- &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The Interior Ministry acknowledged Thursday that an Iraqi police officer whose existence had been denied by the Iraqis and the U.S. military is in fact an active member of the force, and said he now faces arrest for speaking to the media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ministry spokesman Brig. Abdul-Karim Khalaf, who had previously denied there was any such police employee as Capt. Jamil Hussein, said in an interview that Hussein is an officer assigned to the Khadra police station, as had been reported by The Associated Press.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The captain, whose full name is Jamil Gholaiem Hussein, was one of the sources for an AP story in late November about the burning and shooting of six people during a sectarian attack at a Sunni mosque.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The U.S. military and the Iraqi Interior Ministry raised the doubts about Hussein in questioning the veracity of the AP&#39;s initial reporting on the incident, and the Iraqi ministry suggested that many news organization were giving a distorted, exaggerated picture of the conflict in Iraq. Some Internet bloggers spread and amplified these doubts, accusing the AP of having made up Hussein&#39;s identity in order to disseminate false news about the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khalaf offered no explanation Thursday for why the ministry had initially denied Hussein&#39;s existence, other than to state that its first search of records failed to turn up his full name. He also declined to say how long the ministry had known of its error and why it had made no attempt in the past six weeks to correct the public record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hussein was not the original source of the disputed report of the attack; the account was first told on Al-Arabiya satellite television by a Sunni elder, Imad al-Hashimi, who retracted it after members of the Defense Ministry paid him a visit. Several neighborhood residents subsequently gave the AP independent accounts of the Shiite militia attack on a mosque in which six people were set on fire and killed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khalaf told the AP that an arrest warrant had been issued for the captain for having contacts with the media in violation of the ministry&#39;s regulations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hussein told the AP on Wednesday that he learned the arrest warrant would be issued when he returned to work on Thursday after the Eid al-Adha holiday. His phone was turned off Thursday and he could not be reached for further comment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hussein appears to have fallen afoul of a new Iraqi push, encouraged by some U.S. advisers, to more closely monitor the flow of information about the country&#39;s violence, and strictly enforce regulations that bar all but authorized spokesmen from talking to media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Maybe he wore an MOI (Ministry of Interior) uniform and gave a different name to the reporter for money,&quot; Khalaf said then. The AP has not paid Jamil Hussein and does not pay any news sources for information for its stories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Thursday, Khalaf told AP that the ministry at first had searched its files for Jamil Hussein and found no one. He said a later search turned up Capt. Jamil Gholaiem Hussein, assigned to the Khadra police station.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the AP had already identified the captain by all three names in a story on Nov. 28-- two days before the Interior Ministry publicly denied his existence on the police rolls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khalaf did not say whether the U.S. military had ever been told that Hussein in fact exists. Garver, the U.S. military spokesman, said Thursday that he was not aware that the military had ever been told.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Khalaf said Thursday that with the arrest of Hussein for breaking police regulations against talking to reporters, the AP would be called to identify him in a lineup as the source of its story.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Should the AP decline to assist in the identification, Khalaf said, the case against Hussein would be dropped. He also said there were no plans to pursue action against the AP should it decline.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.................&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;E&amp;amp;P note: As recently as yesterday, Michelle Malkin, the best-known blog critic of Hussein&#39;s existence, stated flatly &quot;the fact that there is no police captain named &#39;Jamil Hussein&#39; working now or ever in either Yarmouk or al Khadra, according to on-the-ground sources in Baghdad. Late this afternoon, she posted part of the AP dispatch above with the comment, &quot;Checking it out. Moving forward....&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She later sent a note to the blog of another Hussein doubter, Allahpundit, stating, &quot;Just to clarify, I’m not apologizing for anything.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another prime Jamil Hussein doubter, Jules Crittenden of the Boston Herald, wrote on his blog on Tuesday, &quot;If Jamil Hussein&#39;s apparent failure to exist is ever acknowledged, it will be buried. The AP&#39;s clients, by and large, don&#39;t care. Nor to the &#39;ethics&#39; gatekeepers in the business.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Riehl, another blogger certain Hussein did not exist, responded today, &quot;Fascinating. But let me be the first to say to the Left, before they lose themselves in glee, I don&#39;t see that bloggers have anything to apologize for, nor do I see this story being at an end.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Confederate Yankee allowed, &quot;As far as the AP&#39;s story goes, it does raise some very interesting questions, and I think I&#39;ll have a very entertaining weekend trying to make sense of it all.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eason Jordan, at his new IraqSlogger site, just two days ago had declared that AP was now in a major &quot;scandal.&quot; He had earlier offered to fly Malkin and another blogger to Baghdad, on his own dime, to search for Hussein. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These fucking children. They think this is all words. That man could wind up dead behind this. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They have placed this man&#39;s life in jeopardy over trying to make the AP look bad. They have no idea of how this could end, which is with a bullet to the head. They may have sentenced a man to death over their juvenile games.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116797050521870503/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116797050521870503&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116797050521870503'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116797050521870503'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/fucking-children.html' title='Fucking Children'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116792678347804258</id><published>2007-01-04T10:59:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-04T11:06:23.500-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The people&#39;s business</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/972662/US_Capitol_Snow-3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/554876/US_Capitol_Snow-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today is the start of the 110th Congress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given that the 107th, 108th and 109th Congresses were geldings, it&#39;s time to actually start running this country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You&#39;re gonna hear some bullshit about bipartisanship from the Kool Kids Klub, but they were the same people who thought Clinton would be impeached, and were mute as Tom DeLay called the cops on the Dems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, my feeling on bipartisanship is this&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/62318/purplefinger.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/152704/purplefinger.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116792678347804258/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116792678347804258&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116792678347804258'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116792678347804258'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/peoples-business.html' title='The people&#39;s business'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116792588815348302</id><published>2007-01-04T10:41:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-04T10:51:28.490-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Is Bush a sociopath?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/924406/bushnegro.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/557947/bushnegro.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt;BuzzFlash has &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot; href=&quot;http://www.buzzflash.com/articles/interviews/049&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: normal;&quot;&gt; up&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash: &lt;/strong&gt;You are a psychiatrist and a psychoanalyst. What is the precedent and what are the limitations of applying a psychoanalytic model to a figure that you don’t know, a public figure? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; There’s a long tradition of what’s called applied psychoanalysis. There’s an actual discipline of it. And what that is is the intense study of a historical figure or even of a fictional character in a novel, but an intense study of everything you can find when you can’t have that person in your consulting room, and then applying psychoanalytic principles to an understanding of their life history. One looks for patterns of behavior. One looks for congruencies in their life story that you can begin to see from different sources. And with the case of Bush, or in studying any historical figure, one looks at their own writings and their own behavior that’s available to the public at large. The other thing that makes it very useful to be able to study someone like Bush is the tremendous number of press conferences and public appearances that he’s made. There’s a lot of chance to observe him in public arenas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The limitations, however, of doing it without knowing the person personally is that I don’t get to use a firsthand relationship with the patient, which is really essential to a good psychoanalysis. Also, I don’t get to use my own counter-transference directly, meaning my feelings towards the patient that get evoked throughout the time of the sessions. I was concerned that I had built in antipathy towards President Bush that I worried would make it much harder for me to do a balanced psychoanalytic approach to him. So I was worried about being a prisoner of my counter-transference, if you will. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That proved to be a very interesting experience intellectually and psychologically for me. As I got to know him better, and as I saw different pictures of him -- including a movie of his 2000 campaign made by Alexandra Pelosi, Nancy Pelosi’s daughter -- he became much more alive to me as an affable, charming person who really was good at making people feel happy, good, and well-cared-for. I learned a lot by watching him and getting to know him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In terms of psychoanalysis, the classical approach of looking at transference and counter-transference was denied me. But the other side of it was that I had a tremendous amount of material to pay attention to. And there’s a long tradition of doing this in my field. Freud did it. In more recent years, the CIA has done psychoanalytic studies or psychological profiling of every foreign leader, with an attempt to help them understand how to negotiate with them and how to predict their responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; Before we get into Bush and what is currently going on, I want to ask a general question about the range of emotions that Americans have toward the whole issue of psychoanalysis -- what might be considered psychological impediments, mental health, and so forth. On the one hand, there’s a stereotype we have -- the Woody Allen-type figure who can never get enough of self-analysis and psychoanalysis, and is constantly monitoring himself. On the other hand, you have someone like Bush, who doesn&#39;t want any psychoanalysis, isn’t interested in self-exploration, not a wit, because he is &quot;normal.&quot; He’s as solid as is the granite on his ranch in Crawford, Texas. As we know, a large segment of the American society has disdain for the concept of psychological problems and they consider that a weakness. They don’t see the need for self-exploration. People are what they are. They don’t look inward. They just look forward. What is your view of that range? Is it safe to say that’s the range of American views? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s very safe to say it. For me to really respond properly to your question would require another book, because it’s such a good question and so important, and so many ways to think about it. So maybe a couple of thoughts about it. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One is that in this country there is a long-standing hatred of dependency. Because of that, the appeal of self-reliance, which was a term coined by Ralph Waldo Emerson in the 1840s, is very great. Presidents Reagan and Bush, and other people, have found that that has struck a chord with many Americans -- the idea of self-reliance. The concept of being like Woody Allen and relying on an analyst is a misinterpretation, in my view, of what analysis is and what it does, because analysis facilitates self-reliance. However, people feel that it causes and invites dependency. What it invites is for people to look at the dependency aspects that exist in all of us, because we were all once dependent on our parents for survival, really. I think that those things persist in the child parts of each of us, usually repressed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second thing about the range of responses to psychoanalysis, I think, is that everyone, including many psychoanalysts, don’t like the idea that we have an unconscious. Freud’s discovery and assertion that there is mental life that is going on inside of each of us that we’re not aware of is a little bit disconcerting, to say the least. I think that we have evidence of an unconscious, like we dream when we’re asleep. We know that we’re able to think when we’re asleep, in fact. We know that things go on mentally inside of us. But if we stop and really pay attention to those things and don’t dismiss them, I think it can cause a lot of anxiety and discomfort. People don’t want to look inside. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But to me, the world is as vast inside as it is outside. It&#39;s like looking at the atom, and you start looking through an electron microscope at all kinds of phenomena, and space, and things that are internal. I think that psychoanalysis is a tool for doing that psychologically. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; There is so much in your book. It’s so rich, and one can read it and agree with it or not, since you are applying analysis from afar. But it certainly raises many possible insights into Bush’s psyche. For instance, you make a lot of the premature death of his sister, Robin, and the way that was handled by his parents, and subsequent issues that arose with that in his later life as a key impact on his psychology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; But let’s start at a point of departure, which is today, December 27th. Being someone who started BuzzFlash in May of 2000, and having watched Bush over the years and devoted so much coverage to him, it seems that since the 2006 election, we’ve crossed into something which is a deeply psychological journey going on with Bush in his motivation with the PR language of &quot;the surge,&quot; and his rejection of the Baker-Hamilton Report. He&#39;s once more deliberating on a new course in Iraq, and this idea of victory, when he can’t define it. No one knows what it is, except it’s not being perceived as losing. What we&#39;re kind of watching now is no longer a political or military conflict unfold, although that’s happening. But in the White House, we’re watching someone’s psychological profile in action. Is there any grounds to follow that theory? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; I think there’s a lot of grounds to follow your theory. First of all, I think that -- and I wanted to link with, since you made the link in your response to my book, to his sister’s death at an early age, and then jumped right into the present day, December 27th, I think that there’s a way to make a link between those two things straightaway -- namely, that he was left alone to manage a catastrophe. His parents abandoned him psychologically and emotionally, both because of their own grief and their own way of dealing with their grief, but also because of how they were as parents in general. Barbara was very preoccupied not just with the loss of her daughter, but with the fact that there was a newborn at home -- Jeb, who was only a few months old. So he was left alone to solve a terrible catastrophe of loss, evoking anxiety and all kinds of things. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can fast-forward that to the present day, and he is now feeling very much in the same situation. Even Scarborough talks about how isolated Bush is, and how it&#39;s like a bunker mentality. I think he has had a bunker mentality all of his life, and that he has covered it over and compensated for it with a tremendous amount of affability and charm. That may be partly because he had trouble reading, so he couldn’t like retreat and become isolated the way some people perhaps do, by hiding in books, or drugs, or whatever. He hid from various things, you know, with alcohol and things. But, mainly, he used his affability and his charm to be able to brush away anybody who might get to the core pain and terror that existed inside of him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that that’s what’s happening now. I think somebody -- the voters, the public, the Baker Commission, various people --have tried to turn the light on. And he is very terrified of any kind of truth that will intrude into his need to cling to preconceptions, because they make him feel safe, and they allow him to stay in his bunker. He looked disgruntled this morning. I was watching his statement about President Ford, who died last night. I was really struck by how ill-at-ease he seemed, and like he didn’t want to be doing it. There are historical reasons for his being ill-at-ease, of course, and that was that Gerald Ford and his own father, H.W., didn’t like each other very much, and there was a lot of conflict between Ford and Bush Senior during the Reagan days, early on. But that -- and Bush Junior, certainly, is famous for holding grudges. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think, more than that, it’s like being told that he has to do something he doesn’t want to do. He developed an attitude from very early on of converting being neglected into a virtue. His having been neglected as a child was turned into a virtue, which is that he’s not going to ever be told what to do by anyone, and he’s going to be stubbornly defiant, no matter what, because anybody who pays attention to him is obviously not doing it out of love, but out of authority and trying to control him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is one of the things that has happened during his Presidency -- the way he’s conducted himself as President, for instance, with Katrina, with not preparing the troops, with various examples of failure of empathy and of failure of concern, and a failure to act and take care of people. It has to do with a replay of his own childhood that he is imposing on the rest of us, and we are all paying for that. I think the power of his psychology is such that he really has flipped his own failure or pushed his own failures or his own conflicts onto the rest of us. He’s gotten all of us to sort of live as potential Katrina victims. That’s how he is, because he was a Katrina victim in his own psyche when he was a child. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; He said, at one point that he wouldn’t really change anything in Iraq. In fact, he seems to be going quite the opposite direction at this point -- I mean, digging in his heels and making exacerbating the situation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; But he was quoted as saying, even if everyone is against him except Laura and his dog, he would continue. It struck me that almost everything he does seems to be distilled to this statement -- which is: I can’t be wrong. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Right. He is being consistent. He is essentially saying that he can’t be wrong and he is not ever going to be proven wrong. What seems like dithering or failure to react to the Baker Commission, is much more of a direct reaction, which is a way of ignoring it completely. He is very honest when he says I’m not going to change. He said that to Tim Russert in 2004. He also said that a couple of months ago, that if everybody in the world disagreed with him, he would sort of stay with Laura and his dog, and that that would be that. He is not going to change. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his Wednesday press conference, he started talking about bipartisan behavior, but hee tried to reshape what seemed to me to be a voter mandate about getting out of Iraq, or changing course, into a message supporting his own needs, and he’s always done that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It comes down to his psychic survival. It’s the fear of being wrong. It’s the fear of shame and humiliation at needing other people. It’s a fear of dependency, like we were talking about earlier about the antipathy towards psychoanalysis. He is determined to never be wrong, and to never make a mistake, because shame is a terrible thing for him. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; I want to return to this statement, which sort of knocked my socks off, that even if it’s just him, Barney, and Laura, he would continue on this course. I guess there are two questions here. One, this is democracy. He is basically saying. he has a right to continue to do whatever he wants, despite that. And two, assuming if everyone else believes, his course is wrong and he believes it’s right, on what authority does he believe that he somehow has insights that no one else in the world has? On what basis would one say that? If everyone thinks you’re wrong and you think you’re right, you have to have some kind of fundamental basis to think that you are the only one that somehow has the knowledge that nobody else has. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; I think your second question is more to the point of his psyche, which is very disturbing. That is, there is a grandiose and somewhat paranoid aspect to him. The word I use in the book was megalomanic, which is that he has a corner on what is right and what is wrong. And he feels that so strongly that nobody is going to be able to shake him. It is a form of a delusion, where a person feels that nothing that can affect them, and nothing can change their point of view. When you’re stuck to a delusion, that’s that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I remember when I was first doing my training in Boston in psychiatry, there was a patient who was very delusional and disturbed. This man had a series of shock treatments, and at the end of his course of treatment, somebody asked him, when he was about to be discharged, what did the shock treatment do for you? He said, “What it did for me is it taught me to keep my mouth shut.” I really think that’s what we have as a President. We have a delusional man who is being taught over and over to keep his mouth shut. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; He did say to Bob Woodward, who had asked him about seeking the advice of his father, George Herbert Walker Bush, that he appeals to a higher authority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; To a higher father, meaning God. Is part of his delusional state that he believes that, indeed, God is talking to him, and he is speaking for God, acting for God? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; It’s hard to know. But I do think, from all the evidence, that is the case -- that he does feel bolstered by his attachment to God. He is both able to use God to defeat his father, because he really can’t stand his father, and at the same time, use God to bolster his world view. He has this amazing sense of connection. Whether he hears voices or talks to God, I have no idea. But very few things about this person would surprise me in this way. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wanted to go back to your statement earlier, though, about democracy. What do we do, and how do we think about the fact that we have a President who is functioning in what is supposed to be a democracy. That opens a whole can of worms which is beyond my ken as a psychoanalyst. But I would have to say that on December 12, 2000, he was appointed to serve as President, not elected. So, in that sense, democracy was never clearly an issue in this country, ever since that fateful day, December 12th, when the Supreme Court handed down their decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But I think the only way to deal with somebody who is this embattled and this delusional is to invoke the 25th Amendment. It’s so ironic that it was only used once, and that was when Gerald Ford became President and Nixon was forced out because he resigned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; But then we have Cheney. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; The way the Republicans did it in ’73 was, they got rid of Agnew first, and they made sure that the person who would be the Vice President would be somebody who would be acceptable to both sides of the aisle. Maybe they should threaten to impeach Cheney first or something, and make Bush appoint somebody else. I’d rather have Cheney than Bush. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; Why is that? Many people would disagree with you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; A lot of people would disagree with me. I really think that Bush is not competent to be President. He is unconsciously destructive. He is out of touch with his cruelty. He is unable to think clearly when presented with new information. He cannot do it. He cannot read. He cannot pay attention to the Baker-Hamilton Report. He never looked at that report. He looked at the opening title, about a new way forward or something, and that’s what he’s been using as his slogan now. He is not able to process information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think Cheney, as much as he is malevolent and destructive and greedy and self-interested as an oil executive and wants absolute power, he’s out front about it. I think that he would have to negotiate in a way that’s different because he can’t not think, whereas Bush doesn’t think.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; It would certainly bring Cheney out of the shadows and make him accountable. Is that what you’re saying?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Yes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; Certainly a key thing in your book and a key thing that occasionally pops up in the press, when they do get into a little psychological speculation, is his relationship with his father. Conventional wisdom, even in the mainstream media, you know, which tends to just follow whatever Bush says -- if he says -- you know, or I should say what Rove says or whatever their PR people say. You know, if they called it a surge -- if the media calls it a surge, even if what we’re talking is about is expanding our military presence in Iraq. It’s no surge. It’s just expanding, sending more G.I.s over there. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But many people in the conventional mainstream press did comment on the fact that the Baker-Hamilton Report was Daddy Bush’s way of intervening. James Baker is sort of the Bush family &lt;em&gt;consigliere,&lt;/em&gt; or whatever, who it was thought could force Junior into a course of action that was more conventional, more acceptable, and some would say an honorable way of withdrawing. The report&#39;s a bit more complicated than that, because it still saved the oil concession for the American companies. But, in essence, it was an effort to kind of rein him in a little bit. And Junior’s rejecting that was rejecting his father intervening, rejecting his father trying to tell him what to do. Did you want to comment about any of that? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s reductionistic to say that it’s rejecting his father and turning the Baker report into an intervention by his father. And by reductionistic, I mean, it oversimplifies things. I think what he does is he turns everybody who disagrees with him into his father. It doesn’t matter whether it’s actually the concrete representation of his father, like Baker, or the voters who vote against staying in Iraq. We have become his father. We are the people he is now defying. He will turn everybody, any authority, anybody who disagrees with him, into a father figure who he’d have to defy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; And why? What’s his basic psychological beef with his father? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; It would be nice to be able to reduce it to one thing. But there is one thing that is very clear, which is that his father was, as Bush was growing up, a superhero. He was an all-American baseball star. George W. Bush was &quot;a jockstrap carrier,&quot; or a cheerleader. His father was a war hero, and George W. Bush was a coward who avoided everything that involved responsibility. His father was a family man devoted to his family, and George W. Bush was a hard-drinking kid who was afraid of being responsible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His father was all the things that Bush was not. He was a big, powerful man in Bush’s eyes -- that’s the first thing. When Bush arrived at Andover, for instance, the prep school that he went to, his father’s pictures were all over the wall as having been a hero there twenty-five years earlier. The pictures are still up. So it was very hard to live up to him. The best way to deal with that is to either carve your own path, or to constantly undermine your father. One of the things that he did was, though, he became very loyal to his father, and in 1988, helped manage his campaign for President against Dukakis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; George W. rode shotgun with Lee Atwater during that campaign. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; He really did a lot of things that were to help his father. But at a deep level, there was a tremendous amount of resentment that he talks about, that is even in his biographies, and wanting to have a fight with his father, man to man, when he would get drunk as a kid. And he didn’t really sober up until 1986, which was halfway through his father’s second term as Vice President. He was really hardly ever sober before that. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other thing with his father is that he was also not around. His father never was there to protect him against a very tough-minded, critical, harsh mother. One of the advantages of having two parents is that when one parent gets off track, the other parent can help protect a child. So you can end up having parents balance each other. So, in that sense, his father was, on the one hand, a hero, but on the other hand, a huge disappointment, because he was never available emotionally. I think that what Bush now is doing is that he is essentially attacking his father yet again. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; Two more questions, and one relates to Cheney. No one really quite understands how Cheney became the Vice President. We know he headed the search committee, and then Bush said: Oh, I like you the best. But what led to all that? Did Bush get a call from someone? Did Cheney just sort of insinuate himself? What is Cheney to Bush? Is he a father figure, or the strong father figure that Bush can embrace? What is going on in that relationship? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; I think it’s more a good cop, bad cop situation. I think that, unconsciously, Cheney is the father that he can control and have work for him. It’s not just a father he can rely on; it’s a father who has to do what he -- Bush -- says. I think that it has much more to do with control and domination. Bush is taking people who worked with his father -- and converting them to his way of working, which is far more radical, far more defiant, far more domineering as a President than his father ever was. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I think that it has to do with controlling people who were his father’s henchmen, which is why it was so easy for him to dismiss Baker. He’s going to dismiss anything from his father. And if he can’t dismiss them, he’ll control them and take them in. The difference is that having Cheney around -- he’s a great hatchet man. He’s really smart. He can help Bush see how to do things, and how to get things done, and at the same time he can be controlled, because he is Bush’s right arm. I think that he functions that way. I don’t think that Cheney is as dominating a driver of policy as many people think he is. Bush has an idea of what he wants to do, and then other people figure out how to get it done. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; Let me bring up the word “sociopath,” because, as you mentioned, it seems Bush has this affability. Until recently, he came off very well on television. Despite his gaffs, somehow he’s got that Q-quotient as they call it, on television, that overcomes his malapropisms and dysfunctional language, and particularly when he’s in the settings that Rove puts together. I’ve known people who have met him who say, you know, it was hard not to like the guy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Right. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; Yet he seems to have very little empathy for the situation of sending more G.I.s off to die. He has empathy that’s scripted, but he doesn’t really seem to have any personal empathy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Right. He is very consistent with being a sociopath. I think you’re not just throwing around a term. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; What does that mean? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; A sociopath is just what you said -- a person who can be very charming, but psychologically is so massively defended against experiencing guilt that he cannot feel empathy. If you don’t feel guilt, you can’t empathize, because you never can feel concern about having hurt somebody else, or anybody else suffering. Guilt reins in destructive behavior. But if you don’t have any guilt, you don’t have to feel any anxiety or anything that will hold you back in terms of being destructive or being hurtful. And that leads you to being unable to feel empathy, because empathy actually threatens your safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you feel somebody else is in trouble, then you may feel you are obligated to do something about it. That’s something that is anathema to a psychopath, and it’s certainly anathema to Bush. So he is really incapable of feeling empathy. What he has figured out, with the help of his advisors, is to run as a &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; so he looks like a person who’s empathic. And his affability is what fooled a lot of people into making them feel that he really was connected to them, because he’s so charming. That is classic psychopathy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; The psychopath or sociopath? &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Same thing. Psychopath is the old word for sociopath. It’s the same term. But even sociopaths have an unconscious. They have to do something with guilt and with conflict. They’ve wiped it out overtly, so what we are left with is a sociopath. Unconsciously, there is a tremendous amount of anxiety and fear, and fear of shame, and fear of humiliation, and a desperate need to maintain psychic integrity above all else. That’s why he also has no empathy -- because he is desperately devoted, which I wrote at the end of my book and concluded with, to protecting himself more than anything else. That’s ultimately what a sociopath is. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;BuzzFlash:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you very much. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Justin A. Frank, M.D.:&lt;/strong&gt; Thank you. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BuzzFlash Interview conducted by Mark Karlin.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116792588815348302/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116792588815348302&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116792588815348302'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116792588815348302'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/is-bush-sociopath.html' title='Is Bush a sociopath?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116789422575305447</id><published>2007-01-04T01:42:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-04T02:03:45.960-05:00</updated><title type='text'>It&#39;s just a drink</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/557155/hijab.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/545189/hijab.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The Hijab has magical anti-man&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;powers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://pandagon.net/2007/01/02/victim-blaming-still-not-cool/&quot;&gt;Victim-blaming, still not cool&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published by Amanda Marcotte January 2nd, 2007 in Gender Issues, Crime&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Please, god, let people stop getting enamored of the idea that the most important battle of all time for gender equality has got to be getting rid of the small perks of being female in the club scene. Yes, yes, it’s true that ladies’ night is discrimination against men, but for some reason anyone who complains about it doesn’t want to hear my solution, with is that women pay 76% of the price men pay on every item until pay equity is reached. This fair solution that addresses all horrible injustices, from ladies night to actual injustices, just doesn’t seem to be a marketable idea for some reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I bring this up because Liz Funk has stepped in it again* with her latest articlebemoaning the fact that because men basically run the nightclubs and women are desired to be seen in them, women get a secondary power of being able to manipulate male power for small favors. You know, like those horribly unjust 25 cent well drinks. To make this entire situation worse, Funk quotes Gary Miller in the story, who is mainly an expert in being a douchebag, as we learned when he got into a big war with Jill at Feministe and the fine folks at Gawker, who didn’t appreciate his bizarre fantasy-masquerading-as-editorial of legions of club sluts crying into their hangover coffee because they keep get the fuck-and-run. From this bizarre fantasy, so you know I’m not joking:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   You just dance. Then you meet a guy, he buys you drinks, you go home with him, then you wait by your phone the whole next week; but he doesn’t call until he’s really drunk at 3 a.m. the following Saturday. So you analyze every detail of your encounter with your friends. You start to think maybe he’s just busy. But really, you’re just the slut from last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women think every guy they have a one night stand with wants to marry them. Gary knows, because he saw it on the teevee. And the teevee will never lie to you about how people really act in order to reinforce stereotypes, now would it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary’s a pig with an overinflated sense of how much women need his approval, so why on earth is Liz Funk quoting him in her article about nightclubs?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   “Bar and club owners definitely exploit women,” said Miller, who wrote an article in November headlined “Girls exchange dignity for attention in trendy clubs” in the Washington Square News, New York University’s student newspaper. “Women become a commodity of the establishment that owners use to draw male patrons in. I think the reason most men go to bars and clubs is to find women. This is why they’ll pay a cover charge while women get in free; they’re paying for the women inside. Bar and club owners know this. They know the success and appeal of their establishment depends on the quantity and attractiveness of the girls inside.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are two major problems here, apparently:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1) That men have more power and money than women and therefore women end up getting treated like a sexual commodity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2) Some women realize they can use their commodification in minor, limited ways to get favors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is the concern of “feminist” Liz and her buddy Gary? Well, we’ll get around to discussing how problematic male dominance is after we’ve convinced every woman ever to avoid ever turning tables and gaining some small pleasures here and there. Men feel they can use you for sex? You should cry and give up on sex rather than use them right back and show them payback’s a bitch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in case this isn’t appalling enough, Funk then breaks into hand-wringing about how women just keep going out there and apparently raping themselves. She invokes poor Jennifer Moore, an 18-year-old rape and murder victim, and then goes on about how the booze somehow rapes you.&lt;br /&gt;.......................................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, women get drunk at clubs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But you know what, most of them go home alone or with female friends. They usually don&#39;t go home with guys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Amanda didn&#39;t mention this in her anger, but the reality is that getting a number is a good night. Getting laid is like winning a lottery scratch off card&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I wouldn&#39;t take any comments on sex in the WSN seriously, as a former member of the paper and NYU alum, I would have to ask what he knows about getting laid. Miller isn&#39;t a pig, he&#39;s just bitter those sluts won&#39;t sleep with him. The fact that he&#39;s a newspaper geek has nothing to do with it, or that he&#39;s a kid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, if I introduced young Gary to Amanda he would have no clue what to say to her. He would just sit there mesmerized and praying she would take his virginity. It&#39;s the same with all these guys. They rage against what they can&#39;t have and don&#39;t understand. Now, Jen and I know her, and found her charming. But a lot of guys can&#39;t deal with a smart, opinionated woman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think Amanda is being a little harsh on him, because he is a kid and he&#39;s talking out of his ass. She&#39;s a woman and there is a gap there which is pretty large. He&#39;s saying shit he doesn&#39;t really understand. This is a kid debating women, and that is always going to be ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I was his age, we went to bars to get fucked up, not meet women. Women were nice, but beer was better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So let me make a couple of points:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women like sex. Sometimes they pick up men. Most, they let them buy them dinner first.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes women get really drunk in bars and dance like strippers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sometimes 18 year old girls are less aware of their surroundings than they should be.  Girls often abandon each other when out. When I was in college, we prevented two rapes of nearly unconscious girls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jennifer Moore was raped by a predator. He hunted her down, kidnapped her and raped her. That had little to do with her being drunk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gary Miller is a kid, Liz Funk an idiot. Women make their own choices, they aren&#39;t trading anything for a drink.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116789422575305447/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116789422575305447&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116789422575305447'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116789422575305447'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/its-just-drink.html' title='It&#39;s just a drink'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116789266518896865</id><published>2007-01-04T01:30:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-04T01:37:45.203-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The Watada Case</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/666798/watada.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/742597/watada.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lt.

Ehren Watada, the first commissioned officer to refuse deployment to Iraq.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Barring some kind of miracle, he will be court-martialed on Feb. 5 at Fort Lewis, about 45 miles south of Seattle. If convicted, he could be sent to military prison for six years. There&#39;s going to be a pretrial hearing today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like many Americans, she believed she could come to the capital city and change the world. Or at least her small part of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She was acting purely on instinct, wanting to do everything in a mother&#39;s power to protect her son. &quot;I&#39;m here to get what I can,&quot; said Ho, who is from Honolulu. Dark hair pulled back. Dark eyes that moisten when she speaks of her son. Soft voice. &quot;I&#39;m going to put it out there.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the very least, she hoped for some kind of letter of support before today&#39;s hearing. Late yesterday afternoon, a letter arrived. After a lot of worry and work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lobbying Congress is no day at the spa.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During her Capitol Hill quest, she was accompanied by several seasoned lobbyists, but they let her do the talking. She moved along the halls, sitting down with staffers in the offices of Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) and Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii) and aides from the offices of Reps. Lynn Woolsey (D-Calif.), John Conyers (D-Mich.) and Maxine Waters (D-Calif.).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In closed-door meetings, Ho told the same story. She sees her efforts as part of a larger, multifaceted wave that is challenging the Bush administration from every angle. At the same time the president is advocating an increase in the number of soldiers in Iraq, there is on the home front an increase in the number of vocal opponents of the war. &quot;I believe my son is part of this movement,&quot; Ho said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have mixed feeling about this case. Watada abandoned his men who were deployed to Iraq. He wasn&#39;t a private, he was an officer and they needed his leadership.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The vast majority or resisters have at least one combat tour under their belt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the other hand, his argument that the war is illegal is clearly a persuasive one. Not one which will past muster with a court martial, but persuasive.

Secure Iraq from the militias?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hello, the militias seem to be the state now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason Bush dropped training is simple. We would be training the Mahdi Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s go over the last month quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early in December, Hakim and his Kurd and Sunni counterparts met with George Bush in Washington. There was even a release of Sadr&#39;s version of Arabic ebonics. People were telling reporters that he needed to basically disappear.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan was that Hakim and others would force Maliki from office and then seek to eliminate Sadr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A stupid plan, given the rapid expansion of the Mahdi Army, from 10 to 60K in under a year, and who can tell what the real numbers are, but one which was gaining steam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadr began manuvering, but more importantly, it became clear that the Mahdi Army had won the support of the Iraqi Shias.  Even in areas which had supported Sistani and Hakim, it was the Mahdi Army which protected them. Sadr had built loyalty among people who had originally opposed him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;People were astonished that Hakim was going to try and run things after dealing with the Americans.  One man said that he would have to seek Sadr&#39;s forgiveness, which was unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Sistani said he would not support a deal which did not protect the Shia majority. Which chopped the legs out from Hakim like an axe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we get to execution day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What better way to show your new power than to bum rush the execution and make sure everyone knows you did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the official film was bland, the cellphone video had the sound of the Mahdi Army cursing Saddam. No Kurds, no Sunnis, this was a show by the Mahdi Army, and the Mahdi Army alone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the &quot;government&quot; went along because it answers to the Sadrists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So what are we supposed to do? Send more men to protect the government, which is now run in effect, by the Sadrists? Who we want to attack to eliminiate his power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sadrists are not going away.  We cannot attack them and expect to win or even keep the support of the government if we do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the point is?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116788476085163211/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116788476085163211&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116788476085163211'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116788476085163211'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/why-escalation-wont-work.html' title='Why escalation won&#39;t work'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116787141347031280</id><published>2007-01-03T19:31:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-03T19:43:34.140-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Time to pray</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070104/2007_01_03t183922_450x323_us_iraq_usa_troops.jpg?x=380&amp;y=272&amp;amp;sig=95gxRv03aXxDkZLShRm9EA--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20070104/2007_01_03t183922_450x323_us_iraq_usa_troops.jpg?x=380&amp;y=272&amp;amp;sig=95gxRv03aXxDkZLShRm9EA--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006634.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;http://michellemalkin.com&lt;wbr&gt;/archives/006634.htm&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;My blogging has been lighter than usual the past few weeks due to family time, Fox News duties, holiday chaos, holiday illness--and, yes, planning for a trip to Iraq. As you know, ex-CNN newsman &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michellemalkin.com/archives/006537.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;Eason Jordan extended an invitation&lt;/a&gt; to me three weeks ago to go to Iraq to investigate the Associated Press/&quot;Jamil Hussein&quot; story. He offered to pay for a trip. As you&#39;ll recall, I asked if he would offer to cover travel and security costs for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.floppingaces.net/jamil-hussein-story/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;Curt from Flopping Aces&lt;/a&gt;--who &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michellemalkin.com/archives/006429.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;broke open&lt;/a&gt; the story of AP&#39;s dubious sources on Thanksgiving weekend and  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.floppingaces.net/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;continues to lead&lt;/a&gt; the blogospheric search for the truth. Jordan agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I spoke with Jordan by phone before Christmas to learn more details of his offer, which I&#39;m not going to get into for privacy and security reasons. (He asked that his discussion be off the record.) I let him know that I had received invitations to embed with the military and planned to follow up on some of these offers concurrently with the investigation of the AP&#39;s reporting. Since our conversation, things have moved at a fast pace on the embed side. Over the holidays, my Hot Air colleague Bryan Preston and I received word that our embed applications had been approved. We have been busy preparing our families and ourselves for the journey. Our overarching goals are two-fold: &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;1) to report on how the troops perceive mainstream media coverage of the war (with a particular focus on the wire services relying on local stringers); and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2) to report on progress and interaction between U.S. troops and Iraqi Army trainees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The &quot;Jamil Hussein&quot; story is one important item on our agenda, but not the only one. As Curt and other bloggers on this story have noted from the beginning, Jamilgate isn&#39;t just about &quot;Jamil Hussein.&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot; Bryan and I plan to do as much on-the-ground reporting as we can to nail down unresolved questions-&lt;/span&gt;-not only about Jamil Hussein and the Hurriya six burning Sunnis allegations, but also about the AP four burning mosque story &lt;a href=&quot;http://hotair.com/archives/2006/12/18/jamilgate-many-jamil-husseins-not-so-many-capt-jamil-husseins/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;discrepancies&lt;/a&gt; and the many other AP sources that our military has publicly challenged--including &quot; &lt;a href=&quot;http://search2.foxnews.com/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;amp;client=my_frontend&amp;proxystylesheet=my_frontend&amp;amp;output=xml_no_dtd&amp;site=fnc&amp;amp;filter=0&amp;sort=date%3AD%3AS%3Ad1&amp;amp;q=Maitham+Abdul+Razzaq&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt; Lt. Maitham Abdul Razzaq&lt;/a&gt;&quot; and more than a dozen police officers &lt;a href=&quot;http://michellemalkin.com/archives/006439.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;listed&lt;/a&gt; by U.S. military spokesman Navy Lt. Michael Dean. There&#39;s also the issue of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.google.com/custom?q=bilal+hussein&amp;sa=Search&amp;amp;cof=AH%3Acenter%3BLH%3A124%3BL%3Ahttp%3A%2F%2Fmichellemalkin.com%2Fgraphics%2Fmm_logo.gif%3BLW%3A750%3BAWFID%3A816d74a6ad07d72e%3B&amp;domains=michellemalkin.com&amp;amp;sitesearch=michellemalkin.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt; detained AP photographer Bilal Hussein&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;And we are looking forward to reporting first-hand on the security situation in Iraq outside the so-called &quot;Green Zone&quot; (International Zone) and talking to as many American and Iraqi Army troops with insights on these and other broader matters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am very heartened by &lt;a href=&quot;http://hotair.com/archives/2007/01/02/jamilgate-eason-jordan-goes-nuclear-on-the-ap/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;Eason Jordan&#39;s post yesterday&lt;/a&gt; challenging the Associated Press&#39;s credibility, but am puzzled that his own crew in Baghdad still has nothing new to report more than a month after bloggers first started raising questions. I hope Jordan follows up on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michellemalkin.com/archives/006579.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;most recent investigative developments&lt;/a&gt; in the blogosphere. As of Dec. 21, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.michellemalkin.com/archives/006590.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; onclick=&quot;return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)&quot;&gt;AP refuses to answer these simple questions &lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I find Malkin a vile person, but this.....&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Malkin thinks this is all bullshit, that the media is lying.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Eason Jordan is going to teach her a lesson, a savage lesson and one she is not prepared to learn.&lt;br /&gt;She cost him his job, well, it&#39;s time for her learn something about that job&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She thinks she can flit around the red zone with no training and actually do more than shit her pants?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is way over her head here and has no clue. She&#39;s going to play reporter and people die doing that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bob Woodruff and Kimberly Dozier were experienced, protected reporters and left Iraq via the Balad-Rhein Main evac flight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iraq isn&#39;t a game, or a joke. And as much as I dislike what she does, I don&#39;t think some private has to die in an IED explosion because she is stupid. She literally seems to have no clue as to the risks she proposes to take.  She thinks she does, but if she did, she wouldn&#39;t be planning to run around asking Iraqis questions.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116787141347031280/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116787141347031280&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116787141347031280'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116787141347031280'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/time-to-pray.html' title='Time to pray'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116786978921187469</id><published>2007-01-03T19:13:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-03T19:16:29.296-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Go, For God&#39;s Sake, Go</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/833755/16.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/458236/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attaturk on Atrios&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_12_31_atrios_archive.html#116786404391692262&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://atrios.blogspot.com/2006_12_31_atrios_archive.html#116786404391692262&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Whatevah! &lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thinkprogress.org/2007/01/03/if-we-surge-and-it-doesnt-work/&quot;&gt;The deep military policy stylings of Fred Kagan:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;“If we surge and it doesn’t work,it’s hard to imagine what we do after that.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;m guessing it&#39;ll be part of the continue to die plan.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Leave, you stupid fuck, leave.

Virgil Goode has managed to take a couple of the old tropes and spin them into something fantastically backwards and offensive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To start with, it’s a letter responding to a constituent who never actually wrote him. Just take a look…&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Dear Mr. Cruickshank:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Thank you for your recent communication. When I raise my hand to take the oath on Swearing In Day, I will have the Bible in my other hand. I do not subscribe to using the Koran in any way. The Muslim Representative from Minnesota was elected by the voters of that district and if American citizens don’t wake up and adopt the Virgil Goode position on immigration there will likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding the use of the Koran. We need to stop illegal immigration totally and reduce legal immigration and end the diversity visas policy pushed hard by President Clinton and allowing many persons from the Middle East to come to this country. I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies that I believe are necessary to preserve the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America and to prevent our resources from being swamped.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   The Ten Commandments and “In God We Trust” are on the wall in my office. A Muslim student came by the office and asked why I did not have anything on my wall about the Koran. My response was clear, “As long as I have the honor of representing the citizens of the 5th District of Virginia in the United States House of Representatives, The Koran is not going to be on the wall of my office.” Thank you again for your email and thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;   Sincerely yours,&lt;br /&gt;   Virgil H. Goode, Jr.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s actually kind of admirable that Goode appears to have written the letter himself, and then sent it, for some reason, to the head of the local chapter of the Sierra Club. So while we don’t understand how we got from Keith Ellison to immigration, or where this imaginary Muslim student came from, we totally support The Virgil Goode Position on Immigration and Other Things Tangentially Related to That, Like the Koran.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Does he plan to have a religious test for election to office, the stupid fuck?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116785262299255450/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116785262299255450&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116785262299255450'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116785262299255450'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/stupid-room.html' title='The stupid room'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116785194639752590</id><published>2007-01-03T14:01:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-03T14:19:07.286-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Translation</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/788309/bushcoke.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/482350/bushcoke.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Do what I say&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110009473&quot;&gt;What the Congress Can Do for America&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let them say of these next two years: We used our time well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BY GEORGE W. BUSH&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, January 3, 2007 12:01 a.m. EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Tomorrow, members of the 110th Congress will take their oaths of office here in Washington. I will have the privilege of working with them for the next two years--one quarter of my presidency, plenty of time to accomplish important things for the American people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Like forcing me from office&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Together, we have a chance to serve the American people by solving the complex problems that many don&#39;t expect us to tackle, let alone solve, in the partisan environment of today&#39;s Washington. To do that, however, we can&#39;t play politics as usual. Democrats will control the House and Senate, and therefore we share the responsibility for what we achieve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Yeah, after six years of a lacky Congress, I will blame you if I can&#39;t get my way&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the days and weeks since the November elections, I have been encouraged by the productive meetings I&#39;ve had with many of the new leaders in Congress from both parties. I am hopeful we can find common ground without compromising our principles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;I have planned to ignore them most carefully&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe we share many of the same goals for the people we serve--and with good will and hard effort, we can find practical ways to advance the American Dream and keep our nation safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My principles are no secret. I have campaigned on them in my races for governor and in two presidential contests, and I have worked hard during my presidency to translate these principles into sound policy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;The fact that I have failed miserably means little. I am still the decider&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I believe that when America is willing to use her influence abroad, the American people are safer and the world is more secure. I believe that wealth does not come from government. It comes from the hard work of America&#39;s workers, entrepreneurs and small businesses. I believe government closest to the people is more responsive and accountable. I believe government plays an important role in helping those who can&#39;t help themselves. Yet we must always remember that when people are hurting, they need a caring person, not a government bureaucracy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Except if they&#39;re an Iraq War vet who can&#39;t get paid for months. Then we wash our hands of them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These are all common-sense principles, and they provide the basis for how I will approach governing with the new Congress. We&#39;ve proved it can be done: When our nation was attacked, Republicans and Democrats came together to pass the Patriot Act and reform our intelligence agencies. When our economy was struggling, we worked together to pass tax relief that has helped our economy grow, create jobs, and raise the standard of living for the American people. When we saw that our public schools were failing our children, we came together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act, insisting on high standards, accountability and better options for parents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;When I bullied Congress to pass these misbegotten laws, I never expected the Dems to ever have a word to say about them. Now, they do and well, I don&#39;t like it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The outcome of the elections has changed the balance of power in Congress, yet the priorities for keeping our country safe and prosperous go beyond party labels.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our priorities begin with defeating the terrorists who killed thousands of innocent Americans on September 11, 2001--and who are working hard to attack us again. These terrorists are part of a broader extremist movement that is now doing everything it can to defeat us in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Yes, the Shias who attacked us on 9/11....wait, Al Qaeda is made up of Sunni fundamentalists. I still have the balls to compare 9/11 to Iraq while Osama lives in Pakistan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the days ahead, I will be addressing our nation about a new strategy to help the Iraqi people gain control of the security situation and hasten the day when the Iraqi government gains full control over its affairs. Ultimately, Iraqis must resolve the most pressing issues facing them. We can&#39;t do it for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;I want to send more people to Iraq so I don&#39;t look bad. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we can help Iraq defeat the extremists inside and outside of Iraq--and we can help provide the necessary breathing space for this young government to meet its responsibilities. If democracy fails and the extremists prevail in Iraq, America&#39;s enemies will be stronger, more lethal, and emboldened by our defeat. Leaders in both parties understand the stakes in this struggle. We now have the opportunity to build a bipartisan consensus to fight and win the war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;You mean the extremists who hung Saddam and cursed him into the grave, oh, the government. &lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;I started this war, didn&#39;t ask for any support and now, I expect people to support me because I can&#39;t look bad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America&#39;s priorities also include keeping our economy strong. The elections have not reversed the laws of economics. It is a fact that economies do best when you reward hard work by allowing people to keep more of what they have earned. And we have seen that businesses can expand and hire more workers when they have more money to invest--and since August 2003, America&#39;s employers have added more than seven million new jobs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Don&#39;t you mess with my low wage economy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also a fact that our tax cuts have fueled robust economic growth and record revenues. Because revenues have grown and we&#39;ve done a better job of holding the line on domestic spending, we met our goal of cutting the deficit in half three years ahead of schedule. By continuing these policies, we can balance the federal budget by 2012 while funding our priorities and making the tax cuts permanent. In early February, I will submit a budget that does exactly that. The bottom line is tax relief and spending restraint are good for the American worker, good for the American taxpayer, and good for the federal budget. Now is not the time to raise taxes on the American people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;I want to fight a war and cut taxes. Yeah, that works. It IS time to raise taxes on your friends however&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By balancing the budget through pro-growth economic policies and spending restraint, we are better positioned to tackle the longer term fiscal challenge facing our country: reforming entitlements--Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid--so future generations can benefit from these vital programs without bankrupting our country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Despite how insanely unpopular my Social Security plans were, I will try to push theft one more time, even though John Dingell and Charlie Rangel will laugh at me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One important message I took away from the election is that people want to end the secretive process by which Washington insiders are able to slip into legislation billions of dollars of pork-barrel projects that have never been reviewed or voted on by Congress. I&#39;m glad Senator Robert Byrd and Congressman Dave Obey--the Democrats who will lead the appropriations process in the new Congress--heard that message, too, and have indicated they will refrain from including additional earmarks in the continuing resolution for this fiscal year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Earmarks are evil. When Dems do it.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But we can and should do more. It&#39;s time Congress give the president a line-item veto. And today I will announce my own proposal to end this dead-of-the-night process and substantially cut the earmarks passed each year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Bwaaaah. A weak, unpopular president asking for what? A line item veto? Is he on crack? &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The strength of our economy also requires us to address some of the biggest issues facing the American people--greater energy security, comprehensive immigration reform, and affordable health care. While progress has been made in each of these areas, we must do more. I look forward to working with Congress on these difficult issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;I want to push my programs regardless of the election results&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our Founders believed in the wisdom of the American people to choose their leaders and provided for the concept of divided and effective government. The majority party in Congress gets to pass the bills it wants. The minority party, especially where the margins are close, has a strong say in the form bills take. And the Constitution leaves it to the president to use his judgment whether they should be signed into law.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Right. The last Congress tried to pretend that the Dems didn&#39;t exist, excluded them from meetings and even called the cops on them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That gives us a clear challenge and an opportunity. If the Congress chooses to pass bills that are simply political statements, they will have chosen stalemate. If a different approach is taken, the next two years can be fruitful ones for our nation. We can show the American people that Republicans and Democrats can come together to find ways to help make America a more secure, prosperous and hopeful society. And we will show our enemies that the open debate they believe is a fatal weakness is the great strength that has allowed democracies to flourish and succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;If you do what I say, despite a total rejection of my policies, everything will be fine. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To the new members of the 110th Congress, I offer my welcome--and my congratulations. The American people have entrusted us with public office at a momentous time for our nation. Let them say of these next two years: We used our time well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(51, 102, 255);&quot;&gt;Yes, with my resignation before an impeachment.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116785194639752590/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116785194639752590&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116785194639752590'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116785194639752590'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/translation.html' title='Translation'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116780673958246245</id><published>2007-01-03T08:50:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-03T07:02:08.230-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Not angry enough</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;storytitle&quot; id=&quot;post-13220&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/01/02/olbermann-special-comment-on-sacrifice/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot;&gt;Olbermann: Special Comment on “Sacrifice”&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class=&quot;postSubline&quot; style=&quot;padding-top: 5px;&quot;&gt;     By:    John Amato on Tuesday, January 2nd, 2007 at 6:52 PM - PST    &lt;/div&gt;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;image13221&quot; src=&quot;http://static.crooksandliars.com/2007/01/ko-scomment.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;ko-scomment.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;235&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Olbermann stepped up and slapped Bush&#39;s plan to use the word &lt;em&gt;&quot;sacrifice&lt;/em&gt;&quot; as an excuse to send more troops to Iraq. Bush needs a new catch phrase to try and deceive the nation with, but Republican talking points won&#39;t work on the people anymore. They are fed up with Bush and this war and sending more troops to die is not an answer. John McCain and Lieberman will now wear&lt;em&gt; &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.crooksandliars.com/2007/01/02/edwards-rips-mccain-doctrine/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;the McCain Doctrine&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; around their necks—as Bill Kristol drools with glee as he&#39;ll finally get his wish.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.crooksandliars.com/Countdown-SC-Sacrifice.wmv&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-WMP &lt;a href=&quot;http://movies.crooksandliars.com/Countdown-SC-Sac.mov&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Video&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-QT (big file)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olbermann: If in your presence an individual tried to sacrifice an American serviceman or woman, would you intervene? Would you at least protest? What if he had already sacrificed 3,003 of them? What if he had already sacrificed 3,003 of them — and was then to announce his intention to sacrifice hundreds, maybe thousands, more?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh fuck no he wasn&#39;t angry enough for me, and he was so angry, even my mother noticed it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But George Bush is in no position to ask for sacrifice from ANYONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He told people to go shopping&lt;/span&gt; after 9/11. Now he wants sacrifice? From whom? The survivors of Iraq?  The Iraqi people?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re all fucking sacrificed out. Teenagers look like horror show freaks because an IED burned them up. What more can they give?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His daughters whore around Argentina and he thinks no one notices? He wants some poor kid from Wal Mart to do &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;another&lt;/span&gt; tour?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we have sacrificed quiet enough for Bush&#39;s Colonial War. Send his fucking daughters and the rest of the Bush brood for his attempt to save his ego.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sacrifice?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hmmm, let&#39;s start with the Iraqi mother who&#39;s son was snatched up from a hospital and killed for being the wrong religion. I think she&#39;s sacrificed a great deal for this war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Or we can walk around Walter Reed&#39;s neurology ward, where they&#39;re building plastic skulls for the wounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we can ask a nurse on the flight from Balad to Rhein Main about sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe we can ask the survivors of Haditha about sacrifice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since no one talks to them, why not ask some grunts about sacrifice. I mean, they&#39;re the ones watching their friends die. Iraqi, American, I think both have sacrificed enough for Bush&#39;s war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think of the Shia women crying on caskets as their children are given a quick burial. Or the mothers who get the phone call, which reads US Government, and the next thing she knows, she&#39;s flying to Germany to see what&#39;s left of her child.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iraq has created a great deal of sacrifice, for many people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Except one group:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush and his friends. He should take those fat, cheetos eating fucks at the think tanks and ship their asses overseas. Let Cliff May run a convoy and have Max Boot drive. Let Goldberg man the .50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let those useless motherfuckers sacrifice more than their filthy fucking mouths.  Let  them do what they ask of others and then denigrate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush must be in a Potemkin Village to think he can ask for sacrifice. Sacrifice? Him and metal heart Cheney did everything but ask for sacrifice. He has no standing to ask for sacrifice. He pissed that away with his tax cuts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a sad little man we have running this country. Sacrifice. What the fuck does George Bush know about sacrifice?

Because the pressure for a special prosecutor won&#39;t relent. And if they refuse to indict, all hell breaks loose. You cannot shoot at a car 50 times, kill one man, wound two others, and walk away clean.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In New Orleans, police who did that are facing first degree murder charges.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116782565894018038/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116782565894018038&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116782565894018038'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116782565894018038'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/bell-grand-jury-empaneled.html' title='Bell grand jury empaneled'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116782464160432896</id><published>2007-01-03T06:32:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-03T06:44:01.640-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Maybe it&#39;s the ghost of Patrick Dorismond</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/396499/scum.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/298920/scum.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Is this a dirty trick as well?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/485284p-408548c.html&quot;&gt;&#39;This is clearly a dirty trick&#39;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giuliani camp says dossier was taken,&lt;br /&gt;copied &amp;amp; returned&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BY DAVID SALTONSTALLand BEN SMITH&lt;br /&gt;DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Rudy Giuliani publicly says he has not decided to run for the White House, but the 140-page dossier details possible hurdles and a fund-raising strategy.&lt;br /&gt;The fledgling Giuliani presidential campaign charged yesterday that it was the victim of a mysterious &quot;dirty trick&quot; in the theft of the former mayor&#39;s political road map for 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The astonishing charge threatened to overshadow the candid details in the 140-page strategy guide obtained by the Daily News from a source sympathetic to a rival campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;This is clearly a dirty trick,&quot; said Giuliani spokeswoman Sunny Mindel. &quot;The voters are sick and tired of this kind of thing.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mindel said that while working on the 2006 campaign trail, a Giuliani aide lost a piece of luggage containing the paper.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;During one leg of his campaign travel, all luggage was removed from a private plane and later put back on,&quot; she said in a statement. &quot;However, one staffer&#39;s bag was not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;After repeated requests over the course of a few days, the bag was finally returned with the document inside. Because our staffer had custody of this document at all times except for this one occasion, it is clear that the document was removed from the luggage and photocopied.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She did not say exactly where or when the strategy paper was lost, or what was in it, but Mindel downplayed its importance, saying it is &quot;simply someone&#39;s ideas which were committed to paper over three months ago.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, the paper outlines personal and political pitfalls for Giuliani and a boldly ambitious fund-raising goal of $100 million for this year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the depth of detail in the document, as well as the contents - which include a more detailed portrait of Giuliani&#39;s financial backers than the campaign has disclosed - belies the notion that the dossier is the stray ramblings of a junior aide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A handwritten memo containing a list of Giuliani&#39;s vulnerabilities - from his second and third wives to his private-sector business - appears to have been written by a senior aide with a focus on fund-raising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Personal notes there and elsewhere in the document suggest that the memo, along with much of the contents of the dossier, were prepared by chief fund-raiser Anne Dickerson, a former campaign aide to President Bush who joined Giuliani amid fanfare in May.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Does any of it cause RWG to lose his lustre? confidence?&quot; the memo asked, referring to Giuliani, whose middle name is William, by his initials. &quot;Donors to drop off?&quot; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunny Mindel should shut the fuck up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giuliani has a second rate team and this is the kind of shit to expect from them, lost documents, whining. Hell, maybe it was the ghost of one of the people murdered by the NYPD during his mayorality. I can see it now, a ghost despositing this in the hands of Pataki or Romney.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What was clear from yesterday&#39;s reporting is that Giuliani isn&#39;t ready for prime time, forget running for president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;New Yorkers find the whole idea of Giuliani running for president amusing. Because he has no shot. This shows exactly how second rate his team is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact is that the Giuliani campaign can&#39;t even explain it&#39;s liabilities well. The refusals to deal with black officials, the living with gay men.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I guess he doesn&#39;t get along well with his ex-wife.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think, in the end, he punks out and makes money. That&#39;s what he does best.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116782464160432896/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116782464160432896&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116782464160432896'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116782464160432896'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/maybe-its-ghost-of-patrick-dorismond.html' title='Maybe it&#39;s the ghost of Patrick Dorismond'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116782364461277559</id><published>2007-01-03T06:24:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-03T06:27:24.656-05:00</updated><title type='text'>London here I come</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I didn&#39;t want to take this position,&quot; he told the Wall Street Journal. &quot;I only agreed because I thought it would serve the national interest, and I will not accept it again.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Undermined&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Maliki, a stalwart of the Shia movement which led the resistance to Saddam Hussein, was sworn in as prime minister for a four year term in May after Sunni and Kurd parties rejected the Shia alliance&#39;s first nominee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It followed four months of political deadlock.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He has since been undermined by sectarian tensions within his majority Shia alliance, as well as opposition from Sunni Arabs politicians who say he has not done enough to dismantle Shia militias.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manner in which Saddam Hussein was executed has also increased the pressure on Mr Maliki&#39;s government.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Correspondents say mobile phone footage showing the former Iraqi leader being taunted as he went to the gallows will make it very hard for Baghdad to convince Sunni Arabs that his execution was not just an act of retaliation against their community by Shias.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116782364461277559/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116782364461277559&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116782364461277559'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116782364461277559'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/london-here-i-come.html' title='London here I come'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116780808636465049</id><published>2007-01-03T01:30:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-03T02:08:06.380-05:00</updated><title type='text'>They close the library?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

Rowdy Students Are Taking Over&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 2, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;MAPLEWOOD, N.J., Jan. 1 — Every afternoon at Maplewood Middle School’s final bell, dozens of students pour across Baker Street to the public library. Some study quietly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others, library officials say, fight, urinate on the bathroom floor, scrawl graffiti on the walls, talk back to librarians or refuse to leave when asked. One recently threatened to burn down the branch library. Librarians call the police, sometimes twice a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a result, starting on Jan. 16, the Maplewood Memorial Library will be closing its two buildings on weekdays from 2:45 to 5 p.m., until further notice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An institution that, like many nationwide, strives to attract young people, even offering beading and cartooning classes, will soon be shutting them out, along with the rest of the public, at one of the busiest parts of its day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Library employees will still be on the job, working at tasks like paperwork, filing, and answering calls and online questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They almost knocked me down, and they run in and out,” said Lila Silverman, a Maplewood resident who takes her grandchildren to the library’s children’s room but called the front of the library “a disaster area” after school. “I do try to avoid those hours.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comfortable Essex County suburb of 23,000 residents, still proud of its 2002 mention in Money magazine on a list of “Best Places to Live,” is no seedy outpost of urban violence. But its library officials, like many across the country, have grown frustrated by middle schoolers’ mix of pent-up energy, hormones and nascent independence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Increasingly, librarians are asking: What part of “Shh!” don’t you understand?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;About a year ago, the Wickliffe, Ohio, library banned children under 14 during after-school hours unless they were accompanied by adults. An Illinois library adopted a “three strikes, you’re out” rule, suspending library privileges for repeat offenders. And many libraries are adding security guards specifically for the after-school hours.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Euclid, Ohio, the library pumps classical music into its lobby, bathrooms and front entry to calm patrons, including those from the nearby high school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A backlash against such measures has also begun: A middle school in Jefferson Parish, La., that requires a daily permission slip for students to use the local public library after school was threatened with a lawsuit last month by the American Civil Liberties Union.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Librarians and other experts say the growing conflicts are the result of an increase in the number of latchkey children, a decrease in civility among young people and a dearth of “third places” — neither home nor school — where kids can be kids.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We don’t consider the world as safe a place as it used to be, and we don’t encourage children to run around, hang around and be free,” said Judy Nelson, president of the Young Adult Library Services Association, part of the American Library Association. “So you have parents telling their kids that the library is a good place to go.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rowland Bennett, who served as the director of the Maplewood Memorial Library for 30 years and is now president of the local school board, said libraries had become “the child care center by necessity.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 204);&quot;&gt;Jen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(204, 102, 204);&quot;&gt;Heard this one on the radio this AM. Unbelieveable but sad. The kids are half the problem, but a lack of anything else to do or where to go is the other. Suburbia if you don&#39;t have a car is a dead zone, and if you do and you&#39;re not a mallrat or a jock you&#39;re still screwed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Why not ask for the cops or the school to help you out? Nothing like a police officer in the lobby to calm kids down.  Or the schools teachers. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116780808636465049/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116780808636465049&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116780808636465049'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116780808636465049'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/they-close-library.html' title='They close the library?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116780727681596761</id><published>2007-01-03T01:20:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-03T01:54:36.830-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Those little sluts</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/236582/burqa.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/57693/burqa.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;They look so much better modest&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/opinion/29fri4.html?ex=1168405200&amp;en=0b3405513d4c7e62&amp;amp;ei=5070&amp;amp;emc=eta1&quot;&gt;Middle School Girls Gone Wild&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By LAWRENCE DOWNES&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 29, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It’s hard to write this without sounding like a prig. But it’s just as hard to erase the images that planted the idea for this essay, so here goes. The scene is a middle school auditorium, where girls in teams of three or four are bopping to pop songs at a student talent show. Not bopping, actually, but doing elaborately choreographed re-creations of music videos, in tiny skirts or tight shorts, with bare bellies, rouged cheeks and glittery eyes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They writhe and strut, shake their bottoms, splay their legs, thrust their chests out and in and out again. Some straddle empty chairs, like lap dancers without laps. They don’t smile much. Their faces are locked from grim exertion, from all that leaping up and lying down without poles to hold onto. “Don’t stop don’t stop,” sings Janet Jackson, all whispery. “Jerk it like you’re making it choke. ...Ohh.

For every African-American parent who spends painstaking hours trying to invoke messages of responsibility and hard work, there are larger, more influential forces overtly and covertly saying such things are reserved for &quot;whites only.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did we go from aspiring to excellence to glorifying debased and otherwise degrading behavior? Can this all be blamed on racism or the lack of affirmative action?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Today&#39;s so-called black culture finds its roots in prison behavior. The &quot;sagging&quot; of one&#39;s pants, the thick cornrows have gone from an inmate ethos to one that is now part of the status quo on the streets.&lt;br /&gt;...................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What is certain is that prisons are doing a better job at recruiting African-American males, in particular, than institutions of higher learning, which brings me back to Douglass.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1264/is_n11_v25/ai_17107515&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;ONE&lt;/a&gt; Google hit disproves this bullshit&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item: &#39;There are more Black men of college age in jail than in college.&#39; It ain&#39;t necessarily so - popular myths about African Americans&lt;br /&gt;Essence,  March, 1995  by George E. Jordan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Take the one about there being more Black men of college age in jail than in college. The truth is that there are more African-American men in college--517,000 as recently as 1991 in undergraduate, graduate and professional schools--than Black men and women combined in state and federal jails. In fact, the proportion of Black male high-school graduates enrolling in college, about 30 percent, has held steady for at least three decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 1991 about 478,100 of all Black male college students were undergraduates attending four-year college. On the other hand, federal statistics show there were 395,245 Black males and females in state and federal prisons in 1991. Even if you include the number of Black men in custody--that is, free on bond awaiting trial or on probation--it probably would not exceed the number of brothers enrolled in institutions of higher learning. So the next time you hear somebody share that piece of misinformation, set her straight.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;IN 2000, it was 476k to 179,000&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Byron Williams needs to either do his research better or stop playing sociologist. Because it&#39;s clear he doesn&#39;t have a fucking clue as to what black people really do. Most graduate high school, most do not go to jail, most work for a living. But once again, another negative, uniformed article about the problems with black men gets a hearing.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116780214559881026/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116780214559881026&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116780214559881026'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116780214559881026'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/stop-with-lies.html' title='Stop with the lies'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116779527288708463</id><published>2007-01-03T01:13:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-02T22:35:33.410-05:00</updated><title type='text'>A few words</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/73594/marinewatch.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/147677/marinewatch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;We sent him to Iraq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am distinctly unimpressed by people who deliver lectures to people who served in Iraq and call them killers, and wonder why they didn&#39;t desert.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you live in the other America, Wal Mart and Stuckeys and the 7 line, the one where you don&#39;t have a college fund or stability, you have a few options. The smart ones get into college, the lucky get good jobs, but for a lot of young men, Germany or the USS Lincoln seems like a good bet.  That America doesn&#39;t have a lot of options, and the fact is, a few years in the service is a good deal, points on civil service exams, some travel, a chance to grow up, money for college.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unless you live in that America, you have no idea what people choose to do.  People choose to make their lives better, and frankly, the parents want them to grow up away from the local losers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That America is one most people live in.  And to sit there and say &quot;why didn&#39;t you desert or why did you enlist&quot; is to be ignorant of how most people live.  The military, until Iraq, was the best deal many of them could get. Even with the shit pay and hassles. The people who walked away served their time in Iraq. Then, they had enough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most people do not get to choose between Harvard and Yale. Most people are lucky to go to college, and if you are not lucky, you still have to work, right? In a country where college is essential for a career. Who&#39;s going to help you without a trust fund or rich relatives?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iraqis don&#39;t have much better choices. There are no jobs, no way to work. The Mahdi Army guys come around and they have money, people respect them, and they get things. Of course, you might get killed in the process, but you can get killed going to the store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#39;t wake up wanting to kill Americans any more than Americans wanted to kill them. But when you have to eat, you choose sides, and working with the Americans not only pays less, it might get you killed.  So you join up and from there, it&#39;s about the same. You plant mines and kill Americans, the Americans try to stop you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So you&#39;re spending your day watching and waiting and hoping you don&#39;t get killed or kill anyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America&#39;s war is immoral, and we all let it happen. The ethnic cleansing of Sunnis is immoral, but it&#39;s what you have to do in the Mahdi Army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Comparisons to the Nazis is dumb. The Nazis wanted to enslave people and control the world. Bush didn&#39;t want to do that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is our colonial war.  Colonial wars are ugly things for all concerned.  We need to blame the people who start them and not the people forced to fight them.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116779527288708463/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116779527288708463&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116779527288708463'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116779527288708463'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/few-words.html' title='A few words'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116774048014863085</id><published>2007-01-02T07:20:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-02T07:21:22.113-05:00</updated><title type='text'>A brief history lesson</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/952169/101st.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/217644/101st.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003526309&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;titlebar_black&quot;&gt;AP Asks: Why So Many Upset by Iraq Death Toll?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text_sm&quot;&gt;   Published: January 01, 2007 10:04 PM ET &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;PHILADELPHIA&lt;/b&gt; The country largely kept the faith during World War II, even as about 400,000 U.S. forces died - 20,000 just in the month long Battle of the Bulge. Before turning against the wars in Korea and Vietnam, Americans tolerated thousands more deaths than in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Has something changed? Do Americans somehow place higher value on the lives of their soldiers now? Do they expect success at lower cost? Or do most simply dismiss this particular war as the wrong one - hard to understand and harder to win - and so not worth the losses?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Associated Press recently posed these questions to scholars, veterans, activists, and other Americans. Their comments suggest that the public does express more pain over the deaths of this war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A death toll of 3,000 simply sounds higher to Americans in this war than it did in other prolonged conflicts of the past century, for a number of reasons, the interviews suggest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;As fewer Americans die in war, their loss is more keenly felt, not necessarily at a personal level, but at a collective and public level,&quot; says historian Michael Allen at North Carolina State University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jeffrey Greenwood, 17, of Plymouth, Mass., though unsure of the exact number of Iraq war deaths, says, &quot;I know it&#39;s enough to make people angry.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Mueller, a political scientist at Ohio State University, calls this casualty sensitivity &quot;the Iraq syndrome.&quot; He described it in an influential journal article last year: &quot;Casualty for casualty, support has declined far more quickly than it did during either the Korean War or the Vietnam War.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the weeks after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in March 2003, public backing was powerful. But opinion began to shift quickly once the Iraqi army was beaten, its leader was forced into hiding, and chemical, biological or nuclear weapons were not found.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;text&quot;&gt;&quot;When is it going to stop? We&#39;re losing a lot of youngsters,&quot; says former tanker Ed Collins, 82, of Hicksville, N.Y., who survived the assault on Normandy&#39;s beaches in World War II. &quot;I went in when I was 18; that was young, too. But we fought for something. Now we have no idea who we&#39;re fighting for and what we&#39;re fighting for.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First of all, colonial wars are unpopular. In all but name, this is our version of the Boer War or Algeria. Neither one of those wars were cheered on by their publics. One of the great hidden facts of British History is that most of the colonial wars were bitterly opposed by the public. Elections turned on ending them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The idea that this should be compared to WWII is ridiculous. Our military is a fraction of the 12m man WWII Army or the 9m Vietnam War army. Each death in Iraq is disproportionally more important because of the size of the force, and would represent a much greater loss. If we were talking 27,000 dead and 180,000 wounded, people might understand why the war is so unpopular. This in a war with no regular army.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, while fewer Americans are fighting, the age and social status of those in combat have changed. With the large scale use of reserve and National Guard, those wounded and killed have a far more striking effect in their communities. When teachers and policemen, and other members of the middle class are wounded or killed, the effect of that is disproportionally higher than when teenage soldiers die.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Third, outside of the History Channel and the Military Channel, the pace and tempo of combat in Iraq has been hidden. Any episode of My War Diary or Shootout will show an Iraq war of frightening intensity. So the deaths have no context. Bush&#39;s lies about Iraq have so poisoned the well that people are shocked when they find out Iraq is extremely dangerous.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Charles Moskos lives in a fantasy world that if only the elite fought, Americans would accept higher losses. When have the elite fought? Most of the wealthy in WWII did not join the Rangers or Airborne, but sought the Navy or Army Air Force. The wealthy in America have never thought carrying a rifle was a sound option.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the whole premise of the AP article is insane. We are losing this war, any chance we had to win it ended in April, 2003. Why should Americans accept 3,000 dead for a colonial war which we are losing? They shouldn&#39;t. This was is illegal and has failed to help US foriegn policy goals. One death is unacceptable, 3,000 should lead to impeachment and trial.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116774048014863085/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116774048014863085&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116774048014863085'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116774048014863085'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/brief-history-lesson.html' title='A brief history lesson'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116772316641190944</id><published>2007-01-02T02:25:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-02T02:32:46.426-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Iraq</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/660651/16.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/469005/16.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush hasn&#39;t got a clue as to what to do.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More training only makes the Mahdi Army stronger.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cuurent government seems to act as Sinn Fein to the Mahdi Army&#39;s IRA.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So who are we supposed to fight?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Bush thinks we can crush the Mahdi Army to save the government, well we&#39;re way&lt;br /&gt;past that.

They include tightening ethics rules for lawmakers, raising the minimum wage, allowing more research on stem cells and cutting interest rates on student loans.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;But instead of allowing Republicans to fully participate in deliberations, as promised after the Democratic victory in the Nov. 7 midterm elections, Democrats now say they will use House rules to prevent the opposition from offering alternative measures, assuring speedy passage of the bills and allowing their party to trumpet early victories.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nancy Pelosi, the Californian who will become House speaker, and Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, who will become majority leader, finalized the strategy over the holiday recess in a flurry of conference calls and meetings with other party leaders. A few Democrats, worried that the party would be criticized for reneging on an important pledge, argued unsuccessfully that they should grant the Republicans greater latitude when the Congress convenes on Thursday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The episode illustrates the dilemma facing the new party in power. The Democrats must demonstrate that they can break legislative gridlock and govern after 12 years in the minority, while honoring their pledge to make the 110th Congress a civil era in which Democrats and Republicans work together to solve the nation&#39;s problems. Yet in attempting to pass laws key to their prospects for winning reelection and expanding their majority, the Democrats may have to resort to some of the same tough tactics Republicans used the past several years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Democratic leaders say they are torn between giving Republicans a say in legislation and shutting them out to prevent them from derailing Democratic bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;There is a going to be a tension there,&quot; said Rep. Chris Van Hollen (Md.), the new chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. &quot;My sense is there&#39;s going to be a testing period to gauge to what extent the Republicans want to join us in a constructive effort or whether they intend to be disruptive. It&#39;s going to be a work in progress.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;House Republicans have begun to complain that Democrats are backing away from their promise to work cooperatively. They are working on their own strategy for the first 100 hours, and part of it is built on the idea that they might be able to break the Democrats&#39; slender majority by wooing away some conservative Democrats.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What slender majority? The Dems have 33 seats, the last congress had a 12 seat difference. Idiot reporters. The weak kneed, used to compromise, need to get their asses taught a lesson. No more grovelling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Anyone who votes with the GOP needs to be reminded what they were elected to do. But I think those are few and far between.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116772223611894135/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116772223611894135&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116772223611894135'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116772223611894135'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/payback-sucks.html' title='Payback sucks'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116772162448010377</id><published>2007-01-02T01:59:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-02T02:07:04.506-05:00</updated><title type='text'>22 Gia Long Street</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/597093/22gialongstreet.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/969309/22gialongstreet.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/02/world/middleeast/02refugees.html?hp&amp;ex=1167800400&amp;amp;en=bc3cf6876e373820&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt; Few Iraqis Are Gaining U.S. Sanctuary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By SABRINA TAVERNISE and ROBERT F. WORTH&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 2, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Jan. 1 — With thousands of Iraqis desperately fleeing this country every day, advocates for refugees, and even some American officials, say there is an urgent need to allow more Iraqi refugees into the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until recently the Bush administration had planned to resettle just 500 Iraqis this year, a mere fraction of the tens of thousands of Iraqis who are now believed to be fleeing their country each month. State Department officials say they are open to admitting larger numbers, but are limited by a cumbersome and poorly financed United Nations referral system.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We’re not even meeting our basic obligation to the Iraqis who’ve been imperiled because they worked for the U.S. government,” said Kirk W. Johnson, who worked for the United States Agency for International Development in Falluja in 2005. “We could not have functioned without their hard work, and it’s shameful that we’ve nothing to offer them in their bleakest hour.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senator Edward M. Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat who is taking over the immigration, border security and refugee subcommittee, plans hearings this month on America’s responsibility to help vulnerable Iraqis. An estimated 1.8 million Iraqis are living outside Iraq. The pace of the exodus has quickened significantly in the past nine months.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some critics say the Bush administration has been reluctant to create a significant refugee program because to do so would be tantamount to conceding failure in Iraq. They say a major change in policy could happen only as part of a broader White House shift on Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t know of anyone inside the administration who sees this as a priority area,” said Lavinia Limón, president of the United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, a nongovernmental refugee resettlement agency based in Washington. “If you think you’re winning, you think they’re going to go back soon.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Iraqis, a tie to the United States is a life-threatening liability, particularly in harder-line Sunni neighborhoods. In 2003, Laith, an Army interpreter who would allow only his first name to be used, got a note threatening his family if he did not quit his job. His neighborhood, Adhamiya, was full of Baath Party loyalists. A month later, his father opened the door to a stranger, who shot him dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Laith’s mother begged him to stop working, but his salary, $700 a month at the time, supported the entire family. Then someone threw a sound grenade at the house. Graffiti appeared on a wall in ugly black paint accusing Laith of selling information about insurgents to the military. Laith and his family moved out of the house. Soon after, it was broken into and photographs of him with American soldiers were found in a family photo album.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They know me,” he said, sitting in one of Baghdad’s hotels, because his family would not allow a Western reporter inside the house. “They know when I come and go.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Iraqis who worked for Americans have already fled the capital or the country, and many plead for help or asylum on a daily basis. Of some 40 nationalities seeking asylum in European countries in the first half of 2006, Iraqis ranked first with more than 8,100 applications, according to the United Nations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Remarkably few apply for refugee status in the United States, mainly because most Iraqis, even those who have worked for the United States government here, simply assume that getting American status is all but impossible. Iraqis cannot apply directly for refugee status in the American Embassy in Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interpreter, Amar, who did not want his full name used, went to at least 10 embassies during a trip to Jordan last fall, but found only blank faces. He counts his sacrifice for America in bones and skin. He is missing a finger, an eye and part of his skull, after a large bomb exploded next to his Humvee last year. He has received two threats to his life. Two bodyguards accompany him everywhere. He stays in three different houses to confuse potential attackers.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There will be no reeducation camps in Sadr&#39;s Iraq. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because it&#39;s not just the Sunnis watching.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If these people are not evacuated to the US, they and their families will be murdered</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116772162448010377/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116772162448010377&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116772162448010377'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116772162448010377'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/22-gia-long-street.html' title='22 Gia Long Street'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116772106683608476</id><published>2007-01-02T01:51:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-02T01:57:46.853-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Sacrifice</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/757719/bushputin.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/665704/bushputin.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;So, do I look like a ruler in this or what?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6223923.stm&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush &#39;to reveal Iraq troop boost&#39;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Justin Webb&lt;br /&gt;BBC News, Washington&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;US President George W Bush intends to reveal a new Iraq strategy within days, the BBC has learnt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The speech will reveal a plan to send more US troops to Iraq to focus on ways of bringing greater security, rather than training Iraqi forces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The move comes with figures from Iraqi ministries suggesting that deaths among civilians are at record highs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US president arrived back in Washington on Monday after a week-long holiday at his ranch in Texas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The BBC has been told by a senior administration source that the speech setting out changes in Mr Bush&#39;s Iraq policy is likely to come in the middle of next week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Its central theme will be sacrifice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The speech, the BBC has been told, involves increasing troop numbers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The exact mission of the extra troops in Iraq is still under discussion, according to officials, but it is likely to focus on providing security rather than training Iraqi forces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;No point in training Casey Sheehan&#39;s killers to kill more Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This also means they want to go into Sadr City.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is where the 110th Congress has got to do their job.

And Lieberman has been turned into a joke.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I know people don&#39;t believe me, but I don&#39;t think Bush&#39;s presidency survives a rejection of his Iraq plan. Because there will be hearings and hard questions and unlike the GOP, people will expect answers.

SANGER, MICHAEL R. GORDON and JOHN F. BURNS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;............&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Over the past 12 months, as optimism collided with reality, Mr. Bush increasingly found himself uneasy with General Casey’s strategy. And now, as the image of Saddam Hussein at the gallows recedes, Mr. Bush seems all but certain not only to reverse the strategy that General Casey championed, but also to accelerate the general’s departure from Iraq, according to senior military officials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;General Casey repeatedly argued that his plan offered the best prospect for reducing the perception that the United States remained an occupier — and it was a path he thought matched Mr. Bush’s wishes. Earlier in the year, it had.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as Baghdad spun further out of control, some of the president’s advisers now say, Mr. Bush grew concerned that General Casey, among others, had become more fixated on withdrawal than victory.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, having ousted Mr. Rumsfeld, Mr. Bush sees a chance to bring in a new commander as he announces a new strategy, senior military officials say. General Casey was scheduled to shift out of Iraq in the summer. But now it appears that it may happen in February or March.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By mid-September, Mr. Bush was disappointed with the results in Iraq and signed off on a complete review of Iraq strategy — a review centered in Washington, not in Baghdad. Whatever form the new strategy takes, it seems almost certain to include a “surge” in forces, something that General Casey insisted earlier this year he did not need and which might even be counterproductive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a telephone interview on Friday, General Casey continued to caution against a lengthy expansion in the American military role. “The longer we in the U.S. forces continue to bear the main burden of Iraq’s security, it lengthens the time that the government of Iraq has to take the hard decisions about reconciliation and dealing with the militias,” he said. “And the other thing is that they can continue to blame us for all of Iraq’s problems, which are at base their problems.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet if Mr. Bush does send in more American forces, historians may well ask why it took him so long. Some Bush officials argue that the administration erred by refusing to send in a bigger force in 2003, or by sufficiently bolstering it when the insurgency began to take hold.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Casey retires in early February, and still opposes this plan, the hearings will be devestating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush&#39;s main problem is a simple one: who is he backing? It is clear that Sadr now runs the government. All this talk of shoving him aside was Green Zone nonsense. One word from Sistani, and that was done.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Mahdi Army is now, in effect, the government&#39;s main force. The uniformed units have only a nominal loyalty to the government&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Iraqis never delivered four of the six Iraqi Army battalions that they had committed to the effort. Some of the Iraqi police units proved to be so infiltrated by Shiite militias that they had to be pulled off duty for retraining.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weaknesses in the Iraqi Forces&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Sunni stronghold of Dora, in southwestern Baghdad, American troops were forced to clear thousands of homes twice: the Iraqi security forces who moved in behind them were too few, and too little dedicated to the task, to keep the insurgents from returning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In neighborhoods like Baya, the Shiite-dominated Iraqi National Police set up menacing checkpoints on the routes Sunnis used to seek medical attention or buy fuel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They were trying to dominate the Sunni population and terrorize them to the point that they would leave Baghdad or leave the neighborhood,” recalled Lt. Col. James Danna, who had led the Second Battalion, Sixth Infantry Regiment, which oversaw those areas. He said that like the first Baghdad security operation, the second also failed. As the American elections approached, White House officials say, they believed it would amount to political suicide to announce a broad reassessment of Iraq strategy. But they recognized that unless they began such a review, they would be forced to accept the conclusions of the final report of the Iraq Study Group — headed by James A. Baker III, the former Republican secretary of state, and Lee H. Hamilton, the former Democratic congressman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The effort started in September, around the time Mr. Bush decided to oust Mr. Rumsfeld. In the days before the election, Mr. Bush suggested during an interview that Mr. Rumsfeld could stay until the end of his term — a deliberately misleading statement that Mr. Bush said later was necessitated by the political season. Similarly, it was days after the election that the White House revealed that a major Iraq review was under way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In public, Mr. Bush continues to insist that he and Mr. Maliki share the same vision. In private, one of his former aides said, “he questions whether Maliki has the will or the power” to make good on any commitments.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American military officers have also wondered if the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government and the Americans share the same vision. Were the Iraqis not pulling their weight because they did not have the capability to provide security and proceed with reconstruction? Or did the Iraqi authorities have a sectarian agenda?&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is only a matter of time before an Iraqi Army unit turns on the US forces. The US has no options, but it pretends it does.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116772037278378901/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116772037278378901&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116772037278378901'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116772037278378901'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/i-need-yes-man.html' title='I need a yes man'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116770577570391241</id><published>2007-01-02T00:41:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-01T21:42:55.720-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Wow</title><content type='html'>&lt;h2&gt;           &lt;a class=&quot;post-title&quot; href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/2007/01/01/good-portents-for-2007/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent Link to Good Portents for 2007&quot;&gt;             Good Portents for 2007          &lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/h2&gt;          &lt;!-- Print the time the article was posted --&gt;          &lt;div class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/index.php?author=1&quot;&gt;Jane Hamsher&lt;/a&gt; @ 4:45 pm&lt;/div&gt;          &lt;!-- The article content --&gt;                    &lt;p&gt; &lt;img id=&quot;image5743&quot; src=&quot;http://static.firedoglake.com/2006/11/8012press-1.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;8012press-1.JPG&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I just wanted to point out something that gave me a lot of hope today.  Sue mentioned it in the FDL comments — over at the WaPo, in response to Joe Lieberman&#39;s Op-Ed calling for a &quot;troop surge,&quot; there are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/comments/display?contentID=AR2006122801055&amp;start=1&quot;&gt;37 pages of negative responses&lt;/a&gt;. When the Deborah Howell incident happened, I recognized many of the names  — Paul Lukasiak, Brad DeLong, TeddySanFran and other regulars at various and sundry blogs heavily populated the pages.  But as I scanned through the 37 pages of people calling out Lieberman and his magical plan for &quot;success&quot; in Iraq for being the folly that it most assuredly is, I didn&#39;t recognize a one.  No, people just spontaneously showed up and were appalled that anyone could be promoting this kind of lunacy.  The response to Lieberman&#39;s call for escallation in the war was loud, forthright and agressive — no more.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Digby points us to &lt;a href=&quot;http://brilliantatbreakfast.blogspot.com/2007/01/brilliant-20-of-2006.html&quot;&gt;Brilliant at Breakfast&lt;/a&gt; where Ned Lamont perches near the top of Jill&#39;s &quot;Best of 2006&quot; list, and I wholeheartedly agree.  The Vietnam war lasted for over a decade and cost the lives of &lt;a href=&quot;http://my.eiis.net/cmart/vietwarstats.html&quot;&gt;58,000 Americans&lt;/a&gt;.   I firmly believe that if Ned Lamont had not been willing to take on Joe Lieberman, the anti-war sentiment we are now seeing would never have achieved this kind of popular acceptance.  Democrats were told it was &quot;political suicide&quot; to mention the war in the months before November, and Ned Lamont proved that wrong.  There is not a politician on Capitol Hill who will look at those 37 pages of comments and not realize that precisely the opposite is true — continued support for this war could end a political career.  &lt;/p&gt; People who believe that victory is measured simply by chalk marks in a win/loss column have no idea how long-term battles are waged.  If this war ends one day sooner or one less person has to die because 37 pages worth of Americans tell Joe Lieberman enough with his vanity war, every bit of effort that you, or I, or Ned Lamont, or anyone else expended toward that end was worth it.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Click on the Lieberman comments.

Novak&lt;br /&gt;Monday, January 1, 2007; Page A13&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Sen. John McCain, leading a blue-ribbon congressional delegation to Baghdad before Christmas, collected evidence that a &quot;surge&quot; of more U.S. troops is needed in Iraq. But not all his colleagues who accompanied him were convinced. What&#39;s more, he will find himself among a dwindling minority inside the Senate Republican caucus when Congress reconvenes this week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Bush and McCain, the front-runner for the party&#39;s 2008 presidential nomination, will have trouble finding support from more than 12 of the 49 Republican senators when pressing for a surge of 30,000 troops. &quot;It&#39;s Alice in Wonderland,&quot; Sen. Chuck Hagel, second-ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee, told me in describing the proposal. &quot;I&#39;m absolutely opposed to sending any more troops to Iraq. It is folly.&quot;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;What to do about Iraq poses not only a national policy crisis but profound political problems for the Republican Party. Disenchantment with George W. Bush within the GOP runs deep. Republican leaders around the country, anticipating that the 2006 election disaster would prompt an orderly disengagement from Iraq, are shocked that the president now appears ready to add troops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recent McCain congressional delegation was composed of sophisticated lawmakers who have made many previous visits to Iraq. They do not minimize the severity of sectarian civil war. They left their meeting with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki doubting any &quot;sense of urgency&quot; after advising him that he must disarm the militias. They recognize that the national police, corrupt and riddled with radicals, constitutes an unmitigated disaster.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McCain has long called for more troops in Iraq. He was supported within the delegation by his ally Sen. Lindsey Graham (S.C.) and by Sen. Joseph Lieberman, the only Democrat on the delegation (though he now calls himself an &quot;Independent Democrat&quot; after losing the Democratic nomination in Connecticut and being elected with Republican votes). But Sen. John Thune (S.D.) calls his support for the surge &quot;conditional.&quot; Sen. Susan Collins (Maine) returned from Baghdad opposing more troops. Rep. Mark Kirk of Illinois, the only House member on the trip, is described as skeptical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How big and how long should a surge be? The 7,000 or 8,000 troops that were first mentioned now have grown to at least 30,000. Congressional advocates talk privately about an infusion of manpower ending about halfway through this year. But retired general Jack Keane, who has become a leading advocate of additional troops, wrote in The Post last week: &quot;Increasing troop levels in Baghdad for three to six months would virtually ensure defeat.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I checked with prominent Republicans around the country and found them confused and disturbed about the surge. They incorrectly assumed that the presence of Republican stalwart James Baker as co-chairman of the Iraq Study Group meant it was Bush-inspired (when it really was a bipartisan creation of Congress). Why, they ask, is the president casting aside the commission&#39;s recommendations and calling for more troops?&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baker was supposed to fix this. He didn&#39;t, because Bush wiped his ass with the ISG report. People attacked it because it didn&#39;t deal with a lot of issues. That wasn&#39;t the point. It was to get Bush to accept withdrawal. He won&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unlike Atrios, I don&#39;t think this lasts until 2009. I think when it&#39;s clear you have 70+ votes against you in the Senate, that either you change your plans or you leave. Bush cannot escalate in the face of massive opposition and the reality that the Sadrists control the government. Saddam&#39;s hanging was a Mahdi Army special. The Hakim coup is not only dead, but dead and buried, because Sistani refused to back it.So the Sadrists run the show in all but name.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do these geniuses think that the Iraqi Army will support an attack on the Mahdi Army? I don&#39;t think so.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116770248470239363/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116770248470239363&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116770248470239363'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116770248470239363'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/clark-cliffords-ghost-lives.html' title='Clark Clifford&#39;s ghost lives'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116768666696879497</id><published>2007-01-01T15:41:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-01T16:24:27.603-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Simple answers to simple questions</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/334907/smile.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/785390/smile.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;David Sirota &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2007/1/1/14402/98399&quot;&gt;asks&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Will we be held hostage by the all-too-frequent naysaying among our all-too-cautious-and-comfortabl&lt;wbr&gt;e “allies” in Washington’s liberal non-profit/think tank circles – people who have good intentions, but too often lack the intestinal fortitude to make enemies of some people they see on the cocktail party circuit?

In the end, there would be three squadrons of Americans who would risk their citizenship, in the face of US law, to fight on the side of the British.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of those seven men, six were dead by 1942, one survived the war. Of the three squardons of Americans, many would later become American aces in American planes in the 8th Air Force&#39;s 4th Fighter Group.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But every one of them chose to fight for what was right without consideration of money, fame or even their own birthright. Sure, some wanted to fly the fast Spitfires over England, but most joined up to stop the Nazis. They knew they were going to where the fight was because the British needed help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robert Asahina&#39;s Just Americans discusses how Japanese Americans volunteered for the US Army. While some were later drafted, while their families sat in concentration camps, 22 of these men would later win the Medal of Honor.  They served a country which denied them basic rights of citizenship for reasons based in greed and paranoia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The acts of these men were selfless, they placed their values above their lives. When they were asked to oppose evil, they didn&#39;t write about it, they went out of their way to confront it at risk to their lives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cheap talk and violent blather of  the right is just that. They fantasize about Churchill and World War II in ways that best befit a bad novel and not the acts of humans. They want to be heroes without heroism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The people they claim to admire put action before words, but what we have are a bunch of blowhards, people who talk big and do nothing who want to wrap themselves in the cloak of heroes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As we discuss the Iraq war and Bush&#39;s insane escalation, we need to remember, those cheering the loudest have risked the least.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116767324651948531/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116767324651948531&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116767324651948531'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116767324651948531'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/selflessness.html' title='Selflessness'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116767167889960196</id><published>2007-01-01T12:08:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-01T12:14:39.136-05:00</updated><title type='text'>They would fuck up a hamburger</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20070101/capt.bag10401011237c.correction_iraq_bag104.jpg?x=380&amp;y=238&amp;amp;sig=XXhQoMHXJqRI87wqeZJliQ--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20070101/capt.bag10401011237c.correction_iraq_bag104.jpg?x=380&amp;y=238&amp;amp;sig=XXhQoMHXJqRI87wqeZJliQ--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/world/middleeast/01iraq.html?ei=5090&amp;en=99480f4b18172c3a&amp;amp;ex=1325307600&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=print&quot;&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;(AP Photo/Hameed Rasheed)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/world/middleeast/01iraq.html?ei=5090&amp;amp;en=99480f4b18172c3a&amp;ex=1325307600&amp;amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;amp;pagewanted=print&quot;&gt;Bush to Hang Hussein Was Questioned&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By JOHN F. BURNS and MARC SANTORA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Dec. 31 — With his plain pine coffin strapped into an American military helicopter for a predawn journey across the desert, Saddam Hussein, the executed dictator who built a legend with his defiance of America, completed a turbulent passage into history on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;............................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The American role extended beyond providing the helicopter that carried Mr. Hussein home. Iraqi and American officials who have discussed the intrigue and confusion that preceded the decision late on Friday to rush Mr. Hussein to the gallows have said that it was the Americans who questioned the political wisdom — and justice — of expediting the execution, in ways that required Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to override constitutional and religious precepts that might have assured Mr. Hussein a more dignified passage to his end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Americans’ concerns seem certain to have been heightened by what happened at the hanging, as evidenced in video recordings made just before Mr. Hussein fell through the gallows trapdoor at 6:10 a.m. on Saturday. A new video that appeared on the Internet late Saturday, apparently made by a witness with a camera cellphone, underscored the unruly, mocking atmosphere in the execution chamber.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This continued, on the video, through the actual hanging itself, with a shout of “The tyrant has fallen! May God curse him!” as Mr. Hussein hung lifeless, his neck snapped back and his glassy eyes open.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The cacophony from those gathered before the gallows included a shout of “Go to hell!” as the former ruler stood with the noose around his neck in the final moments, and his riposte, barely audible above the bedlam, which included the words “gallows of shame.” It continued despite appeals from an official-sounding voice, possibly Munir Haddad, the judge who presided at the hanging, saying, “Please no! The man is about to die.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Shiites who predominated at the hanging began a refrain at one point of “Moktada! Moktada! Moktada!”— the name of a volatile cleric whose private militia has spawned death squads that have made an indiscriminate industry of killing Sunnis — appending it to a Muslim imprecation for blessings on the Prophet Muhammad. “Moktada,” Mr. Hussein replied, smiling contemptuously. “Is this how real men behave?”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;American officials in Iraq have been reluctant to say much publicly about the pell-mell nature of the hanging, apparently fearful of provoking recriminations in Washington, where the Bush administration adopted a hands-off posture, saying the timing of the execution was Iraq’s to decide.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While privately incensed at the dead-of-night rush to the gallows, the Americans here have been caught in the double bind that has ensnared them over much else about the Maliki government — frustrated at what they call the government’s failure to recognize its destructive behavior, but reluctant to speak out, or sometimes to act, for fear of undermining Mr. Maliki and worsening the situation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a narrative assembled from accounts by various American officials, and by Iraqis present at some of the crucial meetings between the two sides, shows that it was the Americans who counseled caution in the way the Iraqis carried out the hanging. The issues uppermost in the Americans’ minds, these officials said, were a provision in Iraq’s new Constitution that required the three-man presidency council to approve hangings, and a stipulation in a longstanding Iraqi law that no executions can be carried out during the Id al-Adha holiday, which began for Iraqi Sunnis on Saturday and Shiites on Sunday.&lt;br /&gt;.................................&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Maliki had one major obstacle: the Hussein-era law proscribing executions during the Id holiday. This remained unresolved until late Friday, the Iraqi official said. He said he attended a late-night dinner at the prime minister’s office at which American officers and Mr. Maliki’s officials debated the issue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One participant described the meeting this way: “The Iraqis seemed quite frustrated, saying, ‘Who is going to execute him, anyway, you or us?’ The Americans replied by saying that obviously, it was the Iraqis who would carry out the hanging. So the Iraqis said, ‘This is our problem and we will handle the consequences. If there is any damage done, it is we who will be damaged, not you.’ ”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To this, the Iraqis added what has often been their trump card in tricky political situations: they telephoned officials of the marjaiya, the supreme religious body in Iraqi Shiism, composed of ayatollahs in the holy city of Najaf. The ayatollahs approved. Mr. Maliki, at a few minutes before midnight on Friday, then signed a letter to the justice minister, “to carry out the hanging until death.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;................................&lt;br /&gt;None of the Iraqi officials were able to explain why Mr. Maliki had been unwilling to allow the execution to wait. Nor would any explain why those who conducted it had allowed it to deteriorate into a sectarian free-for-all that had the effect, on the video recordings, of making Mr. Hussein, a mass murderer, appear dignified and restrained, and his executioners, representing Shiites who were his principal victims, seem like bullying street thugs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the explanation may have lain in something that Bassam al-Husseini, a Maliki aide closely involved in arrangements for the hanging, said to the BBC later. Mr. Husseini, who has American citizenship, described the hanging as “an Id gift to the Iraqi people.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leader of Mr. Hussein’s Albu-Nasir tribe, Sheik Ali al-Nida, said that before flying to Baghdad on an American helicopter, he had been so fearful for his safety that he had written a will. Bizarrely, Sheik Nida and others were shown on Iraqi television collecting the coffin from the courtyard in front of Mr. Maliki’s office, where it sat unceremoniously in a police pickup.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the burial, several mourners threw themselves on the closed casket. One, a young man convulsed with sobs, cried: “He has not died. I can hear him speaking to me.” Another shouted, “Saddam is dead! Instead of weeping for him, think of ways we can take revenge on the Iranian enemy,” Sunni parlance for the Shiites now in power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;................&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did Maliki rush to do this? Because his protector wanted it done. Why else?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116767167889960196/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116767167889960196&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116767167889960196'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116767167889960196'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/they-would-fuck-up-hamburger.html' title='They would fuck up a hamburger'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116765613905423417</id><published>2007-01-01T07:52:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-01T07:55:39.086-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The exile</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/728472/New%20Orleans%205.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/166749/New%20Orleans%205.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://select.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/opinion/01herbert.html&quot;&gt;The Not Wanted Signs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By BOB HERBERT&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 1, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;I’ve heard the concern expressed dozens of times by New Orleans residents who are poor and black and still living in enforced exile from their wounded city: &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Maybe they don’t want us back.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You hear it again and again and again, the tone of voice varying from sadness to anger to resignation, but always laced with the unmistakable pain of feeling unwelcome in one’s own home. I’ve come to think of it as the New Orleans lament.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“They are not trying to bring us home,” said Geraldine Craig, who is living in a federally sponsored trailer encampment in Baton Rouge. “Just the opposite. They’re telling us to find housing here.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It hurts,” said Mimi Adams, a woman who wore out her welcome with relatives in Houston and Atlanta but has no idea when she might return to New Orleans. “Even if I could find a place, the rents are too high,” she said. “They’ve gone up a lot. I’m told they don’t want us poor folks back, that they’re making it a city for the well-to-do. That’s what I’m hearing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sixteen months have passed since the apocalyptic flood that followed Hurricane Katrina. More than 13,000 residents who were displaced by the storm are still living in trailers provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Another 100,000 to 200,000 evacuees — most of whom want to return home — are scattered throughout the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The undeniable neglect of this population fuels the suspicion among the poor and the black, who constitute a majority of the evacuees, that the city is being handed over to the well-to-do and the white.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you talk to public officials, you will hear about billions of dollars in aid being funneled through this program or that. The maze of bureaucratic initiatives is dizzying. But when you talk to the people most in need of help — the poor, the elderly, the disabled, the children — you will find in most cases that the help is not reaching them. There is no massive effort, no master plan, to bring back the people who were driven from the city and left destitute by Katrina.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116765613905423417/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116765613905423417&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116765613905423417'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116765613905423417'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/exile.html' title='The exile'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116765460507099279</id><published>2007-01-01T07:25:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-01T07:30:05.106-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The easy way</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/01/us/madison600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2007/01/01/us/madison600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Andy Manis for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;There are more than 100 drinking establishments &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;in downtown Madison, home to the main state &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;university campus. In recent years thousands of &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;young professionals and retirees have moved to the area.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/01/us/01madison.html?hp&amp;ex=1167714000&amp;amp;en=a27921d094d827c5&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt; This Remaking of Downtown Has Downside&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By SUSAN SAULNY&lt;br /&gt;Published: January 1, 2007&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;MADISON, Wis. — This college town received what it wanted when, during the 1980s and 90s, it sought to reverse the decline of its downtown and to create a more vibrant civic center that would draw people at night and on weekends.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, thousands of young professionals, retirees and former suburbanites have moved to glistening condominium buildings in the shadow of the state Capitol’s dome and only a few blocks from the University of Wisconsin’s main campus. And there is hardly a bad night for business near State Street, where university students and tourists pack restaurants and bars to capacity even on freezing weeknights.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as downtown’s population and revelry have grown, so have overcrowding on the streets, vandalism and, most significantly, the police say, alcohol-related crime. Mayor Dave Cieslewicz and other officials find themselves grappling with a problem that is a direct result of Madison’s successful transformation: how to tone down downtown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As an urban issue, the downsizing of downtowns has little precedent because many cities, particularly in the Midwest, are struggling mightily to bring people back to their cores, not send them away.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, many college towns deal with problems related to drinking. In the Midwest alone, La Crosse, Wis., and East Lansing and Ann Arbor, Mich., are struggling with how to cope with the public mayhem often fueled by inebriated students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Madison, two Common Council members, convinced that much of what ails downtown can be traced to the proliferation of bars and restaurants known more for drinking than dining, introduced a plan intended to reduce the number of such establishments, and to restrict the approval of new liquor licenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plan, which has the support of Mayor Cieslewicz (pronounced chess-LEV-ich), is preliminary and does not detail, for example, how many or which places may be closed. A final plan is expected to be ready for a Council vote in the spring.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That area of nearly one square mile — between Lake Mendota, Lake Monona and Blair and Lake Streets — has 120 places that serve only or mostly alcohol. They have a capacity of more than 11,000 people, city officials said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proposal has its critics, many of whom call it nothing less than modern-day Prohibition, and an assault on personal freedom and the free market that flies in the face of Madison’s traditional liberalism and Wisconsin’s entrenched drinking culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some Council members say they worry that limiting the number of bars will only increase the number of drinkers who turn to house parties and makeshift taverns, where binge drinking and bad behavior often go together but behind closed doors.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“A lot of the activists on this issue revile alcohol, and their logic is equally fallacious as the original Prohibitionists’,” said Austin King, the president of the Common Council and a member of its Progressive caucus. “From a safety perspective,” Mr. King said, “I would much, much rather have young people drinking in the regulated environment of bars.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want a vibrant downtown, you can get it in several ways, increased shopping, a central tourist destination, but bars are the cheapest and the most problemmatic way to do that. You get the crowds, but you get the foolishness which comes with it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116765460507099279/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116765460507099279&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116765460507099279'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116765460507099279'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2007/01/easy-way.html' title='The easy way'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116763514406912167</id><published>2007-01-01T02:03:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2007-01-01T02:05:44.120-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Happy New Year</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061231/capt.xaf10112311854.philippines_new_year_s_revelry__xaf101.jpg?x=280&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=xI63M8rCLtc5vHYb5RA_iA--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061231/capt.xaf10112311854.philippines_new_year_s_revelry__xaf101.jpg?x=280&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=xI63M8rCLtc5vHYb5RA_iA--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt; (AP Photo/Aaron Favila)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Happy New Year.

A wrong turn on a snowy road. That&#39;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us don&#39;t own GPS&#39;s in our car, forget accurate map reading. And we would feel silly sticking a case of bottled water, a camping stove and freeze dried food in our car. Most of us never go father than up and down a well-travelled highway. I mean, we would be more likely to use the water to fill up the radiator than to save our lives.  It would seem paranoid to drive around with that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Until nature strikes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What this reminds me of is how close we live to nature. We like to pretend we don&#39;t&lt;br /&gt;, but tragedies like this, which happen every winter, remind us that we live at the mercy of nature, not the other way around.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Kim did the best he could in the situation, and saved his family at the cost of his life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It just reminded me how few Americans are prepared to deal with nature when it crashes into their life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Muslimphobia&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;When  Rashad came into my bedroom, he smiled, knowing I had fallen for his dusky Muslim ways.  He roughly woke my husband, the infidel, up and shoved him to his knees, so he could properly prepare Rashad to enter all my holes.........&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of the Muslimphobia sounds like stories adapted from Literotica, substituting Muslims for blacks.  The abject hysteria over Keith Ellison winning a Congressional seat reached comic proportions. Are these people aware that Muslims have Top Secret/SCI clearance as members of Special Operations Units, the NSA and CIA. That Muslims have served this country faithfully since they have been in the US?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No. They worry about the Koran instead.  A book.  The whole thing is almost comic to see in print.  People like Debbie Schussel think they are more than cranks with computers, when their world view is so beyond reality, one can only laugh.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Jeanine Pirro&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;If you don&#39;t live in the Empire State, you missed the weirdest drama of the year. Pirro, who faltered when she tried to run for Senate, was found to be using Bernie Kerik to investigate her cheating husband Al. Al is a convicted felon. Yet she wanted to run for Attorney General.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK. But then, it turned out she refused to review a case of an innocent man who spent 12 years in jail.  Oooops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Madonna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, she basically bought a baby from Africa and the poor father had to go along. Weird doesn&#39;t begin to cover this. The kid wasn&#39;t an orphan. But she has a billion dollars. At least the Portuguese used to leave salt and muskets behind.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The Birth of Suri&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve never seen such cynicism about a birth in my life. First, Cruise wasn&#39;t the father, then the baby looked Asian, then it was a test tube baby. They were hiding the child. Jesus, you would think it was Children of Men and a child of Cruise and Holmes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The collapse of the right blogosphere&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Remember how the year started? People took Powerline, Red State and Instacracker seriously.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, when they tried to promote Young Ben from Red State, he got gutted and exposed as a plagiarist and racist in a day or so, and from there, it didn&#39;t get any better. Mike Krempasky had problems with Wal Mart, which was quietly sending bloggers PR pieces to defend their company from facts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But my favorite moment of impotence, showing the divergent growth patterns between right and left, is the way the right had to sit and watch how the NRCC savaged conservative Steve Laffey in Rhode Island to save a doomed Chaffee campaign. They had no power to raise money, or even rally people to their cause. Other people they raised money for lost.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They bitched and moaned about AP photos, but no one cared. When Chris Bowers raised a couple of million dollars and Matt Stoller helped campaigns draw support, the right sat at their keyboards, impotent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now they rage against Muslims as they lose relevancy by the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Gossip&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, so tell me who acts unlike a 2o something college student?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Paris Hilton&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lindsay Lohan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nicole Ritchie&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Britney Spears&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ms. USA&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the exception of Spears, who would be returning from Iraq, the rest did nothing worthy of notice, but this, and Jennifer Anniston&#39;s dating life comprised this year&#39;s gossip.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What fallow fields we have. Once gossip used to be fun. Now, it&#39;s the dorm RA&#39;s meeting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;CBS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They sued Howard Stern and hired Katie Couric.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How did that work for them?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stern is doing fine on sattelite and a hell of a lot happier. Couric is an embarassment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Les Moonves, not a genius.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The World Cup&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;More readers posted here every day during the world cup than at any other time. I kept hearing about soccer exceptionalism, but the ratings, on ESPN/ABC were high enough to make everyone happy. Even though the US crapped out, again, I think people realized that we crossed a line in terms of how soccer is seen. It is the number 2 youth sport in the US, it has a growing fan base, and interest in soccer is growing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s dominating American media, but it is no longer the stepchild of American sport. The Olympics, however, was a blip on the media screen, despite millions in hype. MY favorite story: Italians in Turin reading about the Italian national team, and eventual cup winners, the Azzuri.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;And&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.....I bought an MacBook&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116761572344819111/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116761572344819111&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116761572344819111'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116761572344819111'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/weird-shit-of-2006.html' title='Weird shit of 2006'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116759266171101037</id><published>2006-12-31T13:59:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-31T14:17:41.753-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The last day of the year</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.post-gazette.com/images3/20050220mfarmy1_230.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 270px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.post-gazette.com/images3/20050220mfarmy1_230.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Matt Freed, Post-Gazette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Chief Warrant Officer Paul S.

Lugar: If Bush Doesn&#39;t Consult Congress On Iraq It Could &quot;Get Ugly&quot;..&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;|  Posted December 31, 2006 12:33 PM&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;GOP Senator and outgoing chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Richard Lugar (R-IN) appeared on Fox News Sunday With Host Chris Wallace to discuss the situation in Iraq. He made a plea for Bush to spend more time consulting Congress, in particular his committee, and made the prediction that if Bush does not spend more time with Congress, he and his cabinet will face increasingly aggressive investigation and more subpoenas. After Lugar described the situation, Wallace observed, &quot;You&#39;re saying this could get ugly.&quot; &quot;Yes, it could,&quot; Lugar responded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;PARTIAL TRANSCRIPT:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WALLACE: It seems pretty clear that President Bush is leaning towards some kind of &#39;surge,&#39; of sending additional US forces into Iraq. Do you support sending in more troops to Iraq?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUGAR: Well, I don&#39;t know whether I do or not. And I say that because my prayer is that President Bush will take the advice that has come frequently, and that is, with people being there on the take-off, they have to support you on the landing. In the past the administration has been inclined, not to disregard Congress, but not to take Congress very seriously. I think this time Congress has to be taken seriously, there&#39;s been an election, Republicans lost the election. There&#39;s going to be a change in leadership on my committee, and likewise on the House side. What I would advise, would be maybe a retreat, it could be right here in Washington, but for several hours, in which the Foreign Relations Committee, just to take our group, really studies, what is the President&#39;s plan? Understands, specifically, who is to be trained, how would the politics affect what we&#39;ve just been talking about...the devolution of the country, the oil money, or anything else. In other words that there be at least be at least some study of this by all of us, before suddenly we are all asked to comment: &#39;Are you in favor or surge, are you in favor of withdrawal?&#39; Six months, three months, all the clichés. These are not going to be very relevant.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WALLACE: But you&#39;re saying do this before the President addresses the nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUGAR: Yes, that would be advisable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;WALLACE: And what if he doesn&#39;t? What if basically, you know, he calls a group of you in, has the meeting around the cabinet room...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUGAR: Which is the usually course.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WALLACE: Yeah, then what?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;LUGAR: Then he can anticipate, not endless hearings, but a lot of hearings, a lot of study, a lot of criticism. In other words, as opposed to having a Foreign Relations Committee that really now is well-informed, understands, may not agree, but understands how you get from place to place, we have an assortment of invitations, demands for subpoenas, all sorts of situations in which Administration figures perhaps reluctantly come to the committee, or don&#39;t come to the committee, or various other experts discuss..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;WALLACE: You&#39;re saying this could get ugly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LUGAR: Yes, it could. And it need not.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is Dick Lugar, not Jim Webb or Ted Kennedy saying this.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lugar had expected Bush to go along with the ISG and he&#39;s not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think we have our Clark Clifford moment.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116759151902642500/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116759151902642500&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116759151902642500'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116759151902642500'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/weve-had-enough-bush.html' title='We&#39;ve had enough, Bush'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116758963496517771</id><published>2006-12-31T13:09:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-31T13:27:40.073-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Do what?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20061229/i/r599889393.jpg?x=380&amp;y=253&amp;amp;sig=iPYVtz7Z9hfvYGFyWDFguw--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20061229/i/r599889393.jpg?x=380&amp;y=253&amp;amp;sig=iPYVtz7Z9hfvYGFyWDFguw--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;REUTERS/Eric Thayer (UNITED STATES)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atrios asks the following question:&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mysteries &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Why people go to Times Square for New Year&#39;s Eve.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...adding, this isn&#39;t a cranky old man &quot;why do people go outside and spend time with other people&quot; post.

We usually let liars slide in America, note Gerald Ford&#39;s praise for comity, but in this one case, just one, he got nailed hard, and a smarmy little fuck was made to apologize. Sometimes you find faith in odd places. The Smoking Gun is one of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;2) Ossie Davis&#39;s, Coretta Scott King&#39;s and James Brown&#39;s funerals&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They may have happened on different days, in different places, but they say a lot about how we got from segregated lunch counters to US Senators. Oddly enough, many of the same people showed up at all three.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ossie Davis was a Harlem legend, in many films, but it wasn&#39;t acting which made him beloved. When no church would hold a service for Malcolm X, he made it happen. He supported the family for years when they were out of the spotlight, while Betty Shabazz rebuilt her life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Coretta Scott King was ill served by her funeral and the manuverings of Eddie Long. They didn&#39;t invite Harry Belefonte to speak at her funeral. He kept that family fed in the days after King&#39;s death, he was in many ways, their best friend. The weakness of the children shone through. At least Joseph Lowery had the courage to tell the president the truth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;James Brown went out a hero. He was the first popular artist to say simply, that he was proud to be black, and hearing that song as a kid changed the world.  He had the kind of flashy, fun, loving funeral he so deserved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As moments go, these three tributes to three very different people say much about changing black America&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;3) Mel Gibson&#39;s rant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Americans like to pretend that racism, and anti-semitism is part of the past. Mel Gibson, despite being the son of one of America&#39;s most prominent Holocaust deniers, hid it well over the years. Then he slipped and the mask came off.  Hollywood kept it secrets well. Until this year&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;4) Tom Cruise goes crazy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one had seen this before, a major movie star go from respect to ridicule in weeks. For years, Pat Kingsley had protected Tomcat from himself. He fired her and replaced her with his sister, and it was off to the races. Cruise made enemies left and right and people questioned his marriage like it was a movie role. It is rare to see self-destruction in public like that&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;5) Hezbollah and the IDF&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everyone thought that the Israelis would steamroll Hezbollah and put them in their place. Well, when the flares which screwed up night vision gear kept flying and helicopter evacuations was impossible, Israel found that Nasrallah&#39;s boys could fight. Once you allowed people to reach rank without politics, their fighting ability improved tremendously. The IDF were fighting the last war. Hezbollah was not.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;6) Swannick, Eaton and Baptiste&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When these former generals, two commanders of units which led to higher command, refuted the DOD line before Congress, something changed. Maybe it was small, maybe big, but these were no hippies. These were former commanders, men who could have reached higher rank and retired instead.  Bush&#39;s war was a fraud and they would fight no more forever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;7) The Muslim Cartoons&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The European right did a little racebaiting and got called on it. They thought that they could mock Islam and Muslims would have to suck it up. The riots proved otherwise.  It was a silly miscalculation by people with no sense of foresight. A lot of people bought into the free speech argument when it was really about putting minorities in their place. They want to debate burkas and homosexuality when the real issue is inclusion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not one US paper would touch these cartoons, in the most open press in the world, for a very simple reason: it was racebaiting. There was no great editorial outcry or protest, because the unsubtle nature of the submissions had nothing to do with freedom of speech.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;8) 500,000 people&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They didn&#39;t know what to make of it, when the streets of LA filled up. All those Mexicans. with kids in the Army, pride in their heritage and a willingness to protest unfair laws. They had to be illegals. The willfully blind like Lou Dobbs and the openly racist like Tom Tancredo, didn&#39;t get it. Most Americans didn&#39;t have a serious problem with immigration. They didn&#39;t like the illegals crossing over, but they didn&#39;t want to turn them into felons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But most of them were Americans and they didn&#39;t like the second class citizenship Tom Tancredo and Jim &quot;Kotex&quot; Sensenbrenner wanted to impose on their relatives. It changed the way Latinos saw politics and killed the GOP outreach program dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;9) Use it or lose it&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the end of the campaign, MyDD&#39;s Chris Bowers started a fundraising drive. He asked members of Congress in safe seats to contribute to the national committees. He raised millions of dollars. And all he did was thought it up and did it.  Didn&#39;t ask permissions, didn&#39;t have to call anyone, just started asking people for money. And maybe won a few close elections by doing so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10) Germany is like everyplace else&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The one thing which happened during the World Cup was subtle, but important. The Germany baiting was gone and Germans were able to wave their flags and take pride in their team like everyone else. It&#39;s been a long time since the Germans didn&#39;t have their history wrapped around them. But when English tourists flooded the country and found the people open and friendly, a lot of minds changed. And if you have a united Europe, the past has to be let go at some point. They started out with the WWII nonsense, but when it ended, that was tossed aside for the present.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116754568176117612/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116754568176117612&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116754568176117612'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116754568176117612'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/10-moments-from-2006.html' title='10 moments from 2006'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116753477882247792</id><published>2006-12-31T01:05:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-30T22:12:58.840-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Nevada Sadr</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/542498/sadr.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/399404/sadr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Payback is a bitch, motherfucker&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ft.com/cms/s/6b4d7076-9836-11db-b2ac-0000779e2340.html&quot;&gt;Violence marks news of Saddam’s execution&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Steve Negus, Iraq Correspondent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 30 2006 19:27 | Last updated: December 30 2006 19:27&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The execution is unlikely to bridge this divide, as perceptions of Mr Hussein’s hanging differ radically between Sunni Arab and Shia. Even the timing of his hanging seemed to reinforce the sectarian gap -- although Iraqi law bans executions during religious holidays, it took place just as the Sunni’s Eid al-Adha feast was beginning. Shia begin celebrations a day later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, Mr Hussein’s death could bolster the confidence of the Shia parties which dominate the government, who are fighting to shore up their popularity among their own constituency&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Shia claimed to doubt that Mr Hussein would actually be executed, leaving the door open to a possible return of his ruling Baath party to power.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even the last minutes of Mr Hussein’s life seemed to reinforce that the old order was gone for good. One of the witnesses, Judge Munir Haddad, was quoted by CNN as saying that as the noose was being tightened around Mr Hussein’s neck, one of the hangmen shouted out “Long live Moqtada al-Sadr.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Moqtada al-Sadr,” said Mr Hussein mockingly, of the radical young cleric Shia who could hardly have been of much consequence to him while he was president, but who now is among the most powerful men in Iraq. According to the report, those were Mr Hussein’s last words.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who do you think drove this execution?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shouldn&#39;t have shot his daddy like a dog, Saddam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As justice, this was vulgar. As revenge, well, Sadr worked long and hard for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nevada Smith is an old western with Steve McQueen, who goes to extreme lengths to kill the men who killed his family. Like going to a Louisiana prison and escaping with one target, who he then kills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadr got his man.

So, here&#39;s a taxonomy of annoying people on our side:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Defeatists&lt;/span&gt; - Doom and gloomers who know it is all hopeless, who know that we can&#39;t win elections, or that if we do win elections nothing will improve, and who think that people who bother to try are just wasting their time. Why these people spend so much time paying attention to this stuff if there&#39;s nothing to be done I do not know. If you really feel that way go do something else with your time, otherwise I expect you&#39;re just addicted to the sweet thrill of self-righteous outrage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Armchair Revolutionaries&lt;/span&gt; - People who are convinced that the only way to enable change is to take to the streets in mass protest movements, and that anyone who isn&#39;t taking to the streets is a big sellout wimp. Whatever the validity of this viewpoint, I say go ahead and do it and convince others to do so. There are, for example, small scale war protests all over the country which people attend every week. Are you attending them? Are you trying to organize more? Or are you just fantasizing about a noble struggle which you aren&#39;t really bothering to take part of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sock Puppeteers&lt;/span&gt; - People who think that I, and every other blogger, exist to give voice to your personal issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The Narcissists&lt;/span&gt; - People who think politicians exist to cater to them personally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Magical Thinkers&lt;/span&gt; - People who speak in semi-riddles, hinting at webs of understood secrets, conspiracies, and truth who actually are just spouting gibberish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The Lazies&lt;/span&gt; - People who think its my job, or any other blogger&#39;s job, to spend time, effort, and money supporting candidates or causes even though they themselves aren&#39;t actually doing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Demanders&lt;/span&gt; - People who demand that people agree with them, rather than thinking that maybe they should try persuasion instead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Forwarders &lt;/span&gt;- People who randomly add others to their personal email lists, forwarding every interesting thing and thought they have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Assumers of Bad Faith&lt;/span&gt; - Those who think that people who disagree with them can&#39;t possibly have come to that opinion honestly, that they must be on the take, or have a hidden agenda, or be misrepresenting themselves, or whatever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And, yes, this list sounds cranky but I&#39;m really just having a bit of fun. More than that, while Time&#39;s Person of the Year was stupid and condescending, the internets do provide an easy way for people to get involved, persuade, and lead. You don&#39;t have to have a &quot;big blog&quot; like this to reach people. If nothing else, Daily Kos and other sites give anyone the potential to have, at least temporarily, a sizeable megaphone which you can use to reach a large audience. In meatspace there are numerous ways you can get involved in local or national politics, or join in with charitable works, or whatever. I&#39;m not telling people they have to do these things, I&#39;m just saying that as some guy once said, you have the power, and the tools are there for you to do so with minimal effort. We live in an age when any idiot on the internets can potentially have an impact on our national discourse, so if you have an issue, or a cause, or a candidate, or whatever, you can try to to organize and persuade and lead. Sitting around in a pool of defeatist narcissistic self-righteous fury while despairing about the grand truths only you understand is good fun, and we all do it at times, but ultimately it doesn&#39;t accomplish anything. If the world isn&#39;t to your liking, try to change it, and as some other guy suggested, you can start by being the change&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of people have some magical expectations of what happens in politics. Some people use it at a personal fashion statement. It isn&#39;t either. It is deadly serious work. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people wonder why others haven&#39;t leaped into the fight the way they expect them to, they need to reflect as to why they haven&#39;t either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what is most fustrating is that people treat this like TV and it isn&#39;t. You can and should participate. This isn&#39;t a contest to see who is most popular. Everyone has a voice and should use it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116753357605289562/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116753357605289562&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116753357605289562'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116753357605289562'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/people-who-annoy.html' title='People who annoy'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116753315698246160</id><published>2006-12-31T00:32:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-30T21:45:58.166-05:00</updated><title type='text'>It isn&#39;t that bad, really</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/222899/cemetery.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/783410/cemetery.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://select.nytimes.com/iht/2006/12/30/world/IHT-30globalist.html&quot;&gt;A Manifesto From the Left Too Sensible to Ignore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By ROGER COHEN&lt;br /&gt;International Herald Tribune&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 30, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;NEW YORK This has been a bleak year for nuanced thinking. President George W. Bush likes to speak in certainties; contrition and compromise are not his thing. Among hyperventilating left-liberals, hatred of Bush is so intense that rational argument usually goes out the window. The result is a mindless cacophony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush, even after the thumping of the Republicans in November, equates criticism of the war in Iraq with defeatist weakness. Much of the left, in both Europe and the United States, is so convinced that the Iraq invasion was no more than an American grab for oil and military bases, it seems to have forgotten the myriad crimes of Saddam Hussein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There appears to be little hope that Bush will ever abandon his with-us-or-against-us take on the post-9/11 world. Division is the president&#39;s adrenalin; he abhors shades of gray. Nor does it seem likely that the America-hating, over-the-top ranting of the left - the kind that equates Guantánamo with the Gulag and holds that the real threat to human rights comes from the White House rather than Al Qaeda - will abate during the Bush presidency.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This state of affairs is grave. The threat posed by Islamic fanaticism, inside and outside Iraq, requires the lucid analysis and informed disagreement of civilized minds. Bush&#39;s certainties are dangerous. But so is the moral equivalency of the left, the kind that during the Cold War could not see the crimes of communism, and now seems ready to equate the conservative leadership of a great democracy with dictatorship. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This kind of sad apologia fools no one outside Fox News and Washington. Gitmo is called a gulag because it is one. They hold children in custody. If that isn&#39;t Stalinesque, what is?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every lemming on the right claims any opposition to Bush is driven by hatred. Really? Someone should ask Charles Swannick if he hates Bush. What Cohen doesn&#39;t get is that only a few pundits like him still support our colonial adventure in Iraq. Everyone else sees what a failure it is and wants it to end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then he brings up the Euton Manifesto, some bullshit by liberal and not so liberal hawks about defending our colonial war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Roger, here&#39;s reality.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Americans avoid enlisting to fight in Bush&#39;s war. We&#39;re taking criminals and 40 year olds to fight because the best and brightest of America would rather work in Wal Mart than face multiple tours in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not one of your friends or your kids friends has one person they know serving in combat overseas. This is all abstraction to you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But understand this: the American people have tired of your war and the cost of it. They want it to end. You and a bunch of warmongers won&#39;t change that.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116753315698246160/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116753315698246160&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116753315698246160'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116753315698246160'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/it-isnt-that-bad-really.html' title='It isn&#39;t that bad, really'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116749366940328460</id><published>2006-12-30T10:45:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-30T10:47:49.453-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Killimg Saddam</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061230/capt.ny11412301109.aptopix_iraq_saddam_hussein_ny114.jpg?x=380&amp;y=285&amp;amp;sig=TheBx81n_TeWGPEFsFfKTA--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061230/capt.ny11412301109.aptopix_iraq_saddam_hussein_ny114.jpg?x=380&amp;y=285&amp;amp;sig=TheBx81n_TeWGPEFsFfKTA--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/12/30/saddam/&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saddam: The death of a dictator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the bumbling of the U.S.-backed regime, justice becomes revenge, and a despot becomes a martyr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Juan Cole&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Photo: Reuters/Chris Hondros&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Dec. 30, 2006 | The body of Saddam, as it swung from the gallows at 6 a.m. Saturday Baghdad time, cast an ominous shadow over Iraq. The execution provoked intense questions about whether his trial was fair and about what the fallout will be. One thing is certain: &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The trial and execution of Saddam were about revenge, not justice.&lt;/span&gt; Instead of promoting national reconciliation, this act of revenge helped Saddam portray himself one last time as a symbol of Sunni Arab resistance, and became one more incitement to sectarian warfare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saddam Hussein was tried under the shadow of a foreign military occupation, by a government full of his personal enemies. The first judge, an ethnic Kurd, resigned because of government interference in the trial; the judge who took his place was also Kurdish and had grievances against the accused. Three of Saddam&#39;s defense lawyers were shot down in cold blood. The surviving members of his defense team went on strike to protest the lack of protection afforded them. The court then appointed new lawyers who had no expertise in international law. Most of the witnesses against Saddam gave hearsay evidence. The trial ground slowly but certainly toward the inevitable death verdict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like everything else in Iraq since 2003, Saddam&#39;s trial became entangled in sectarian politics. Iraq is roughly 60 percent Shiite, 18 percent Sunni Arab and 18 percent Kurdish. Elements of the Sunni minority were favored under fellow Sunni Saddam, and during his long, brutal reign this community tended to have high rates of membership in the Baath Party. Although many members of Saddam&#39;s own ethnic group deeply disliked him, since the U.S. invasion he has gradually emerged as a symbol of the humiliation that the once-dominant Sunni minority has suffered under a new government dominated by Shiites and Kurds. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116749366940328460/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116749366940328460&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116749366940328460'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116749366940328460'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/killimg-saddam.html' title='Killimg Saddam'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116749135331596119</id><published>2006-12-30T10:03:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-30T10:09:13.356-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Not again</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://media1.suntimes.com/nixoncds/image/henderson1.jpg_20061227_23_30_46_613-282-400.imageContent&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://media1.suntimes.com/nixoncds/image/henderson1.jpg_20061227_23_30_46_613-282-400.imageContent&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;credit&quot;&gt;(John H.

He&#39;s married and working toward a college degree -- but the Army has called upon him again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A letter he received two weeks before Christmas orders him to report to Fort Benning, Ga., by Jan. 14. Under the order, he is required to fight in Iraq for a period &quot;not to exceed 545 days.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this time, Henderson says he will not serve his country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It would take a miracle for me to put on a uniform again and to carry a weapon in Iraq,&#39;&#39; he said. &quot;I have no intentions of going to Iraq.&#39;&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Henderson, 34, mailed off an appeal to the military Wednesday in hopes he can get out of the obligation. He already completed four years of active duty, including 17 months in operations all over Afghanistan. He received several commendations and even appears in Not a Good Day to Die, a book about Operation Anaconda, a U.S.-led assault in eastern Afghanistan in 2002. The book recounts an operation where Henderson and another soldier survived heavy enemy fire. &quot;That was the longest 18 hours of my life,&#39;&#39; he recalled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At her Olympia Fields home Wednesday, Henderson&#39;s mother, Kathleen White, teared up when thinking that her only son could end up back in harm&#39;s way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His stepfather, Herbert White, who relies on his stepson for help around the house as he awaits a liver transplant, said he was worried about his son going abroad for potentially the third time. &quot;How many chances does he have before something really bad happens?

And the remaining flights that could carry the remains were all booked as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Without a second thought, Murrell yanked the backseats out of his Ford van and loaded up. He and a co-worker piloted the Ford Club Wagon van up I-95 with the Rev. Al Sharpton, the funeral home director and Brown&#39;s 24-karat gold-plated coffin in back.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We talked the whole time,&quot; added Murrell who owns a transportation company in Augusta. &quot;Old times, the good old days, all the fun that we had, all the people he touched, the lives that he changed. It went on and on.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And as soon as they reached New York, they flipped on the radio to find Brown&#39;s songs playing nonstop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The incredible journey started with a frantic phone call from the C.A. Reid Sr. funeral home around 5:30 p.m. Wednesday telling Murrell there was trouble.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The custom-designed coffin - which needed its blue lining replaced with a special one of white satin - was running late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There was no time to make the 2-1/2-hour trip from Augusta to Atlanta in time for the 7:45 p.m. scheduled Delta flight - or any other flights that night - they said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All charter flights were booked, including Murrell&#39;s two planes. And eager crowds were already massing in Harlem to say goodbye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;They had to get him to the Apollo. They tried everything,&quot; said Murrell, &quot;It was my last chance to give him a ride of a lifetime.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116746251049734675/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116746251049734675&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116746251049734675'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116746251049734675'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/last-ride.html' title='The last ride'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116746184899567465</id><published>2006-12-30T01:53:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-30T01:57:29.020-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Saving our Iraqi allies</title><content type='html'>&lt;a style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot; onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061225/capt.bag10112250908.iraq_christmas_bag101.jpg?x=380&amp;y=253&amp;amp;sig=PaARvfjb6heYDTa6ToSrhQ--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061225/capt.bag10112250908.iraq_christmas_bag101.jpg?x=380&amp;y=253&amp;amp;sig=PaARvfjb6heYDTa6ToSrhQ--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt; (AP Photo/Karim Kadim)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Guarding Iraqi Christians&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/29/AR2006122901066.html&quot;&gt;We Can&#39;t Ignore Iraq&#39;s Refugees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Edward M. Kennedy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;........................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;There is an overwhelming need for temporary relief and permanent resettlement. Last year, however, America accepted only 202 Iraqi refugees, and next year we plan to accept approximately the same number. We and other nations of the world need to do far better.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thousands of these refugees are fleeing because they have been affiliated in some way with the United States. Cooks, drivers and translators have been called traitors for cooperating with the United States. They know all too well that the fate of those who work with U.S. civilians or military forces can be sudden death. Yet, beyond a congressionally mandated program that accepts 50 Iraqi translators from Iraq and Afghanistan each year, the administration has done nothing to resettle brave Iraqis who provided assistance in some way to our military. This lack of conscience is fundamentally unfair. We need to do much more to help Iraqi refugees, especially those who have helped our troops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our nation is spending $8 billion a month to wage the war in Iraq. Yet to meet the urgent humanitarian needs of the refugees who have fled the war, the State Department plans to spend only $20 million in the current fiscal year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;America needs to lead, but we cannot adequately respond to this overwhelming crisis alone. Because of the magnitude of the problem, we also need action by Iraq&#39;s neighbors and the rest of the world. An essential first step could be to hold an international conference on the issue -- ideally sponsored by the countries in the region and the United Nations -- to begin to deal with the growing number and needs of Iraqi refugees and internally displaced persons. The United States should participate in the conference and provide substantial support for the refugees. Doing so would encourage other nations to address the crisis, help the refugees and displaced persons, and assist the countries shouldering the greatest burden.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working with Iraq&#39;s neighbors and the United Nations, we can encourage rapid action to relieve suffering and save lives. And a productive conference could lead in turn to broader discussions and greater progress on the future of Iraq&lt;/blockquote&gt;..........................</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116746184899567465/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116746184899567465&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116746184899567465'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116746184899567465'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/saving-our-iraqi-allies.html' title='Saving our Iraqi allies'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116746135531208587</id><published>2006-12-30T01:46:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-30T01:49:15.353-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Helping the unbanked</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/12/30/nyregion/30card_lg.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/12/30/nyregion/30card_lg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Aaron Houston for The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Germania Hernandez activates a Sigo card for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Buenaventura Pacheco Lopez in New Brunswick, N.J.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/30/nyregion/30card.html?ref=nyregion&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Immigrants Wary of Banks Put Faith in New Card&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By STEVEN GREENHOUSE&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 30, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. — Since coming to this country eight years ago, Jose Dimas has bristled at the $8 fee he often must pay to cash his paycheck. He stews over the $10 charge he faces whenever he wires $150 home to his parents in Mexico.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Daunted by the requirements to open a bank account, Mr. Dimas had long kept his savings hidden in his apartment, and had worried that his money would be stolen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But now Mr. Dimas, 32, a food preparer at a catering company, has a new tool that has eased his discomfort with all things financial. It is a special debit card, provided not by a bank but by a nonprofit worker center here, enabling hundreds of immigrants without checking accounts or credit cards to keep their cash somewhere safer than beneath their mattresses. The card also makes it easier to shop at stores as well as online.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This card is better for me for a lot of situations,” Mr. Dimas said. “You don’t have to pay those big charges to send money back to Mexico. And it will be much safer. I don’t like keeping my money in my home. Someone could go steal the money.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The worker center, called New Labor, normally focuses on preaching about worker solidarity and safety, but after seeing all the hassles that immigrants face with finances, it pioneered the new debit cards. In a survey of 480 immigrants who were members of New Labor and similar worker centers, 47 percent said they had no bank accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since November, New Labor has provided cards to 200 immigrant members, including some who are here illegally. Three other centers — in Hempstead, N.Y., Chicago and Los Angeles — have begun offering the cards as well, and organizers say they hope to make them available to tens of thousands of immigrants at 140 worker centers nationwide within the next few years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several financial experts said the new debit cards — named “Sigo,” combining the Spanish word for “yes” and the English “go” — are an ideal tool for 30 million workers, both foreign-born and native, who lack bank accounts and often face high check-cashing fees and frustrating obstacles in paying bills.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sigo cards can also help so-called “unbanked” immigrants develop financial sophistication and eventually move into the banking system, these experts said, perhaps to obtain a mortgage or small business loan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s not just about reducing your financial costs and making your financial life easier, it also helps give you opportunities to get ahead,” said Jennifer Tescher, director of the Center for Financial Services Innovation in Chicago, which provided a grant to develop the program. “It saves you time and makes more products and services available to you.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Like department store gift cards, the Sigo card has stored value, but unlike those cards, it is reloadable, meaning more money can be added. Users can reload the cards by having paychecks deposited directly into their accounts or by making cash deposits — for fees ranging from 50 cents to $5 — at a local pharmacy or worker center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sigo card requires a PIN number and is affiliated with MasterCard, and can be used wherever MasterCard is accepted.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116746135531208587/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116746135531208587&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116746135531208587'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116746135531208587'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/helping-unbanked.html' title='Helping the unbanked'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116745305355565032</id><published>2006-12-30T01:16:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-29T23:30:54.230-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Idiocy in action</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/258206/mahdiarmy2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/918738/mahdiarmy2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.commentarymagazine.com/cm/main/printArticle.aip?article=com.commentarymagazine.content.Article::10135&quot;&gt;Getting Serious About Iran:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Military Option&lt;br /&gt;By Arthur Herman&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The first step would be to make it clear that the United States will tolerate no action by any state that endangers the international flow of commerce in the Straits of Hormuz. Signaling our determination to back up this statement with force would be a deployment in the Gulf of Oman of minesweepers, a carrier strike group’s guided-missile destroyers, an Aegis-class cruiser, and anti-submarine assets, with the rest of the carrier group remaining in the Indian Ocean. The U.S. Navy could also deploy UAV’s (unmanned air vehicles) and submarines to keep watch above and below against any Iranian missile threat to our flotilla.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our next step would be to declare a halt to all shipments of Iranian oil while guaranteeing the safety of tankers carrying non-Iranian oil and the platforms of other Gulf states. We would then guarantee this guarantee by launching a comprehensive air campaign aimed at destroying Iran’s air-defense system, its air-force bases and communications systems, and finally its missile sites along the Gulf coast. At that point the attack could move to include Iran’s nuclear facilities—not only the “hard” sites but also infrastructure like bridges and tunnels in order to prevent the shifting of critical materials from one to site to another.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, the air attack would concentrate on Iran’s gasoline refineries. It is still insufficiently appreciated that Iran, a huge oil exporter, imports nearly 40 percent of its gasoline from foreign sources, including the Gulf states. With its refineries gone and its storage facilities destroyed, Iran’s cars, trucks, buses, planes, tanks, and other military hardware would run dry in a matter of weeks or even days. This alone would render impossible any major countermoves by the Iranian army. (For its part, the Iranian navy is aging and decrepit, and its biggest asset, three Russian-made Kilo-class submarines, should and could be destroyed before leaving port.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scenario would not end here. With the systematic reduction of Iran’s capacity to respond, an amphibious force of Marines and special-operations forces could seize key Iranian oil assets in the Gulf, the most important of which is a series of 100 offshore wells and platforms built on Iran’s continental shelf. North and South Pars offshore fields, which represent the future of Iran’s oil and natural-gas industry, could also be seized, while Kargh Island at the far western edge of the Persian Gulf, whose terminus pumps the oil from Iran’s most mature and copiously producing fields (Ahwaz, Marun, and Gachsaran, among others), could be rendered virtually useless. By the time the campaign was over, the United States military would be in a position to control the flow of Iranian oil at the flick of a switch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An operational fantasy? Not in the least. The United States did all this once before, in the incident I have already alluded to. In 1986-88, as the Iran-Iraq war threatened to spill over into the Gulf and interrupt vital oil traffic, the United States Navy stepped in, organizing convoys and re-flagging ships to protect them against vengeful Iranian attacks. When the Iranians tried to seize the offensive, U.S. vessels sank one Iranian frigate, crippled another, and destroyed several patrol boats. Teams of SEALS also shelled and seized Iranian oil platforms. The entire operation, the largest naval engagement since World War II, not only secured the Gulf; it also compelled Iraq and Iran to wind down their almost decade-long war. Although we made mistakes, including most grievously the accidental shooting-down of a civilian Iranian airliner, killing everyone on board, the world economic order was saved—the most important international obligation the United States faced then and faces today.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the so-called “tanker war” did not go far enough. In the ensuing decades, the regime in Tehran has single-mindedly pursued its goal of achieving great-power status through the acquisition of nuclear weapons, control of the Persian Gulf, and the spread of its ideology of global jihad. Any effective counter-strategy today must therefore be predicated not only on seizing the state’s oil assets but on refusing to relinquish them unless and until there is credible evidence of regime change in Tehran or—what is all but inconceivable—a major change of direction by the reigning theocracy. In the meantime, and as punishment for its serial violations of UN resolutions and of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, Iran’s oil resources would be impounded and revenues from their production would be placed in escrow.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, no plan is foolproof. The tactical risks associated with a comprehensive war strategy of this sort are numerous. But they are outweighed by its key advantages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, it would accomplish much more than air strikes alone on Iran’s elusive nuclear sites. Whereas such action might retard the uranium-enrichment program by some years, this one in effect would put Iran’s theocracy out of business by depriving it of the very weapon that the critics of air strikes most fear. It would do so, moreover, with minimal means. This would be a naval and air war, not a land campaign. Requiring no draw-down of U.S. forces in Iraq, it would involve one or two carrier strike groups, an airborne brigade, and a Marine brigade. Since the entire operation would take place offshore, there would be no need to engage the Iranian army. It and the Revolutionary Guards would be left stranded, out of action and out of gas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, there is little Iran could do in the face of relentless military pressure at its most vulnerable point. Today, not only are key elements of the Iranian military in worse shape than in the 1980’s, but even the oil weapon is less formidable than imagined. Currently Iran exports an estimated 2.5 million barrels of oil a day. Yet according to a recent report in &lt;em&gt;Forbes&lt;/em&gt;, quoting the oil-industry analyst Michael Lynch, new sources of oil around the world will have boosted total production by 2 million barrels a day in this year alone, and next year by three million barrels a day. In short, other producers (including Iranian platforms in American hands) can take up some if not all of the slack. The real loser would be Iran itself. Pumping crude oil is its only industry, making up 85 percent of its exports and providing 65 percent of the state budget. With its wells held hostage, the country’s economy could enter free fall.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fucking idiot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What does he think the Mahdi Army would do? Watch this happen?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once the Iranians see this unfold, their Iraqi friends take over from the criminal gangs and blow the bridges the US needs to supply their units. They start going after convoys. Baghdad explodes in protests.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fucking assclown. A Marine brigade? An Airborne Brigade? From where? When Iranian commandos reach out to their Shia friends in Saudi Arabia and blow the pipelines, what happens then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because the Iranians are not morons, they have countermoves planned and 140,000 hostages in Iraq.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116745305355565032/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116745305355565032&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116745305355565032'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116745305355565032'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/idiocy-in-action_30.html' title='Idiocy in action'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116745104059937683</id><published>2006-12-30T00:47:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-29T23:09:21.480-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Saddam murdered by Iraqi government</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061230/2006_12_29t223237_318x450_us_iraq.jpg?x=243&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=.lu8Yv4.Sw5XOBBaYK3e7A--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061230/2006_12_29t223237_318x450_us_iraq.jpg?x=243&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=.lu8Yv4.Sw5XOBBaYK3e7A--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, Bush got his &quot;victory&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Raed Jarrar  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/raed-jarrar/there-is-no-victory-in-sa_b_37402.html?source=widget&quot;&gt;There Is No Victory in Saddam&#39;s Execution &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Although news reports everywhere are contradicting themselves during this fluid situation, the truth is Saddam might be hanged very soon, within the next few hours or days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This comes at a time when the Bush project is collapsing in Iraq. On the American side, the number of U.S. troops killed will reach to 3000 in the next few days.&lt;br /&gt;On the Iraqi side, new attempts to create a pro-occupation coalition in the Iraqi government (led by Hakim, Hashimi, and Talbani-Barazani) failed after Sistani rejected the idea and refused to give his blessings. At the same time, an anti-occupation coalition is emerging inside and outside the Iraqi government and will include everyone except the failed pro-occupation alliance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, there are problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     * At the same time that millions of Iraqis were and are still being killed, injured, and displaced because of the U.S. interventions;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     * At the same time that the Iraqi social fabric is being destroyed and turned into fragments;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     * At the same time that the state Iraq is being literally &quot;wiped off the map&quot; and cut apart;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     * At the same time that everyday in Iraq is worse than the day before;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;     * And at the same time that tens of thousands of U.S. solders are being killed, injured, and traumatized for the rest of their lives and trillions of the U.S. taxpayers&#39; money wasted -&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--the one and only victory that the Bush administration can claim is hanging the former dictator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The U.S. administration will use Saddam to distract public opinion from the atrocities going on by parading this fake &quot;victory.&quot; It will then also bury the executed body of Saddam along with all the secrets we&#39;re not supposed to know, continuing to leave us in the dark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The crimes of Saddam&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With all due respect to the 158 victims of Al-Dujail - where an assassination attempt was made against Saddam -- and their families, this incident was minor when compared to the other major atrocities committed during Saddam&#39;s era and supported by the U.S.,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These atrocities included the War on Iran (and the U.S. military support), the dirty political deals (like giving the green light to Saddam&#39;s attack on Kuwait and the following written permission to the Iraqi government in Safwan to crush the southern revolution in 1991). They also included the chemical weapons sold to Iraq (like the ones used against Iran on the war fronts, and Iraqi Kurds in the north of Iraq). And there were many more political and economical secret deals and crimes against Iraqis and other people in the region.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are many people, like Mr. Tareq Aziz, the former Iraqi Vice President and Prime Minister, who are still asking to testify in cases related to Al-Dujail and Al-Anfal (the attacks against Kurds). Aziz said that he has information that will &quot;embarrass many people inside and outside Iraq&quot;. But there were people were denied the chance to let us all know the truth, because this truth is not convenient to the Bush administration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saddam indeed was a brutal dictator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that atrocities worse than those caused by him are now going on during the occupation, should make the Bush administration feel ashamed that they have made Saddam&#39;s brutal dictatorship look like a walk in the park.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens next&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iraqis don&#39;t miss Saddam, but they miss their national government that was inherited by the Baath regime and was destroyed under this occupation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Saddam&#39;s life or death is irrelevant to the current Iraqi situation. Iraqis are fighting to hold their country together and get it back from the foreign occupiers. Saddam&#39;s recent trial and imminent execution are nothing more than evidence of how foreign interventions to change political regimes will destroy entire countries and split entire nations. The current situation in Iraq is a good indicator for how Iran and Syria, or other countries, would look if the U.S. administration went ahead and interfered and changed their political regimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iraqis were besieged by more than eight revolutions and coup d&#39;états since the end of the British occupation in 1921. Yet, none of those events destroyed Iraq the way the current U.S.-led occupation has and continues to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These devastating events, the senseless deaths and political skulduggery, and the annihilation of an independent state have proven that Iraqis are the only ones who have the capability, and the right, to change their political regime without destroying their country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The only way a certain regime can be changed, or enhanced, without destroying the rest of the country is when the change comes from within; when the people are given the chance to change their own regimes by themselves. Otherwise, we&#39;ll end up having other Iraqs around the region and the rest of the world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Written in collaboration with Jennifer Hicks&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116745104059937683/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116745104059937683&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116745104059937683'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116745104059937683'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/saddam-murdered-by-iraqi-government.html' title='Saddam murdered by Iraqi government'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116745141311003788</id><published>2006-12-29T22:59:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-29T23:03:33.133-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The worst year ever</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20061228/i/r1523906915.jpg?x=380&amp;y=249&amp;amp;sig=rzArnJVWtvDiw5iGtcEcSQ--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/rids/20061228/i/r1523906915.jpg?x=380&amp;y=249&amp;amp;sig=rzArnJVWtvDiw5iGtcEcSQ--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Iraqi politicians performing for US officials&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Riverbend has something to say&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday, December 29, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://riverbendblog.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_riverbendblog_archive.html#116738820591750213&quot;&gt;End of Another Year...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know your country is in trouble when:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  1.The UN has to open a special branch just to keep track of the chaos and bloodshed, UNAMI.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2.Abovementioned branch cannot be run from your country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;3.The politicians who worked to put your country in this sorry state can no longer be found inside of, or anywhere near, its borders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;4.The only thing the US and Iran can agree about is the deteriorating state of your&lt;br /&gt;nation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;5.An 8-year war and 13-year blockade are looking like the country&#39;s &#39;Golden Years&#39;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;6.Your country is purportedly &#39;selling&#39; 2 million barrels of oil a day, but you are standing in line for 4 hours for black market gasoline for the generator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;7.For every 5 hours of no electricity, you get one hour of public electricity and then the government announces it&#39;s going to cut back on providing that hour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;8.Politicians who supported the war spend tv time debating whether it is &#39;sectarian bloodshed&#39; or &#39;civil war&#39;.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;9.People consider themselves lucky if they can actually identify the corpse of the relative that&#39;s been missing for two weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A day in the life of the average Iraqi has been reduced to identifying corpses, avoiding car bombs and attempting to keep track of which family members have been detained, which ones have been exiled and which ones have been abducted.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2006 has been, decidedly, the worst year yet. No- really. The magnitude of this war and occupation is only now hitting the country full force. It&#39;s like having a big piece of hard, dry earth you are determined to break apart. You drive in the first stake in the form of an infrastructure damaged with missiles and the newest in arms technology, the first cracks begin to form. Several smaller stakes come in the form of politicians like Chalabi, Al Hakim, Talbani, Pachachi, Allawi and Maliki. The cracks slowly begin to multiply and stretch across the once solid piece of earth, reaching out towards its edges like so many skeletal hands. And you apply pressure. You surround it from all sides and push and pull. Slowly, but surely, it begins coming apart- a chip here, a chunk there.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is Iraq right now. The Americans have done a fine job of working to break it apart. This last year has nearly everyone convinced that that was the plan right from the start. There were too many blunders for them to actually have been, simply, blunders. The &#39;mistakes&#39; were too catastrophic. The people the Bush administration chose to support and promote were openly and publicly terrible- from the conman and embezzler Chalabi, to the terrorist Jaffari, to the militia man Maliki. The decisions, like disbanding the Iraqi army, abolishing the original constitution, and allowing militias to take over Iraqi security were too damaging to be anything but intentional.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question now is, but why? I really have been asking myself that these last few days. What does America possibly gain by damaging Iraq to this extent? I&#39;m certain only raving idiots still believe this war and occupation were about WMD or an actual fear of Saddam.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al Qaeda? That&#39;s laughable. Bush has effectively created more terrorists in Iraq these last 4 years than Osama could have created in 10 different terrorist camps in the distant hills of Afghanistan. Our children now play games of &#39;sniper&#39; and &#39;jihadi&#39;, pretending that one hit an American soldier between the eyes and this one overturned a Humvee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This last year especially has been a turning point. Nearly every Iraqi has lost so much. So much. There&#39;s no way to describe the loss we&#39;ve experienced with this war and occupation. There are no words to relay the feelings that come with the knowledge that daily almost 40 corpses are found in different states of decay and mutilation. There is no compensation for the dense, black cloud of fear that hangs over the head of every Iraqi. Fear of things so out of ones hands, it borders on the ridiculous- like whether your name is &#39;too Sunni&#39; or &#39;too Shia&#39;. Fear of the larger things- like the Americans in the tank, the police patrolling your area in black bandanas and green banners, and the Iraqi soldiers wearing black masks at the checkpoint.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, I can&#39;t help but ask myself why this was all done? What was the point of breaking Iraq so that it was beyond repair? Iran seems to be the only gainer. Their presence in Iraq is so well-established, publicly criticizing a cleric or ayatollah verges on suicide. Has the situation gone so beyond America that it is now irretrievable? Or was this a part of the plan all along? My head aches just posing the questions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What has me most puzzled right now is: why add fuel to the fire? Sunnis and moderate Shia are being chased out of the larger cities in the south and the capital. Baghdad is being torn apart with Shia leaving Sunni areas and Sunnis leaving Shia areas- some under threat and some in fear of attacks. People are being openly shot at check points or in drive by killings… Many colleges have stopped classes. Thousands of Iraqis no longer send their children to school- it&#39;s just not safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why make things worse by insisting on Saddam&#39;s execution now? Who gains if they hang Saddam? Iran, naturally, but who else? There is a real fear that this execution will be the final blow that will shatter Iraq. Some Sunni and Shia tribes have threatened to arm their members against the Americans if Saddam is executed. Iraqis in general are watching closely to see what happens next, and quietly preparing for the worst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is because now, Saddam no longer represents himself or his regime. Through the constant insistence of American war propaganda, Saddam is now representative of all Sunni Arabs (never mind most of his government were Shia). The Americans, through their speeches and news articles and Iraqi Puppets, have made it very clear that they consider him to personify Sunni Arab resistance to the occupation. Basically, with this execution, what the Americans are saying is &quot;Look- Sunni Arabs- this is your man, we all know this. We&#39;re hanging him- he symbolizes you.&quot; And make no mistake about it, this trial and verdict and execution are 100% American. Some of the actors were Iraqi enough, but the production, direction and montage was pure Hollywood (though low-budget, if you ask me).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That is, of course, why Talbani doesn&#39;t want to sign his death penalty- not because the mob man suddenly grew a conscience, but because he doesn&#39;t want to be the one who does the hanging- he won&#39;t be able to travel far away enough if he does that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maliki&#39;s government couldn&#39;t contain their glee. They announced the ratification of the execution order before the actual court did. A few nights ago, some American news program interviewed Maliki&#39;s bureau chief, Basim Al-Hassani who was speaking in accented American English about the upcoming execution like it was a carnival he&#39;d be attending. He sat, looking sleazy and not a little bit ridiculous, his dialogue interspersed with &#39;gonna&#39;, &#39;gotta&#39; and &#39;wanna&#39;... Which happens, I suppose, when the only people you mix with are American soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My only conclusion is that the Americans want to withdraw from Iraq, but would like to leave behind a full-fledged civil war because it wouldn&#39;t look good if they withdraw and things actually begin to improve, would it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here we come to the end of 2006 and I am sad. Not simply sad for the state of the country, but for the state of our humanity, as Iraqis. We&#39;ve all lost some of the compassion and civility that I felt made us special four years ago. I take myself as an example. Nearly four years ago, I cringed every time I heard about the death of an American soldier. They were occupiers, but they were humans also and the knowledge that they were being killed in my country gave me sleepless nights. Never mind they crossed oceans to attack the country, I actually felt for them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Had I not chronicled those feelings of agitation in this very blog, I wouldn&#39;t believe them now. Today, they simply represent numbers. 3000 Americans dead over nearly four years? Really? That&#39;s the number of dead Iraqis in less than a month. The Americans had families? Too bad. So do we. So do the corpses in the streets and the ones waiting for identification in the morgue.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Is the American soldier that died today in Anbar more important than a cousin I have who was shot last month on the night of his engagement to a woman he&#39;s wanted to marry for the last six years? I don&#39;t think so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just because Americans die in smaller numbers, it doesn&#39;t make them more significant, does it?&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116745141311003788/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116745141311003788&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116745141311003788'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116745141311003788'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/worst-year-ever.html' title='The worst year ever'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116741395714156001</id><published>2006-12-29T12:34:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-29T12:39:17.176-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The execution of the Czar</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/753884/yekcz3.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/836789/yekcz3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The execution site of the Czar and his family&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_II_of_Russia&quot;&gt; Death&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;T&lt;blockquote&gt;he provisional Russian government at first kept Nicholas, Alexandra, and their children confined in the Alexander Palace at Tsarskoe Selo, 15 miles south of St. Petersburg. Attempting to remove them from the vicinity of the capital and so from possible harm, the Kerensky government moved them east to Tobolsk, in Siberia in August 1917. They remained there through the Bolshevik October Revolution in November 1917, but were then moved to Red Army and Bolshevik-controlled Yekaterinburg. The Emperor and his family, including Botkin, Kharitonov and Trupp were executed at 2:33 A.M. on the morning of July 17, 1918. According to Yurovsky he read to Nicholas a letter from the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet saying:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;   In view of the fact that your relatives continue their offensive against Soviet Russia, the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet has decided to sentence you to death.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Yurovsky, Nicholas II cried:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Lord, oh my God! Oh my God! What is this? I can&#39;t understand you.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodies were disposed in a truck which Yurovsky ordered at midnight and taken to the forest to be disposed. The execution was covered up as a disappearance for a while. Soon after, the Bolsheviks announced that only Nicholas had been shot, but that the members of his family had been spirited away to another place. Most reports showed that they had all been executed by a detachment of Bolsheviks led by Yakov Yurovsky, a watchmaker from Perm. Other witnesses swore to have seen the Empress and her daughters in Perm. King Alfonso XIII of Spain negotiated with the new Soviet government interceding for the remaining members of the family that he thought alive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then in 1989, Yakov Yurovsky&#39;s own report was published, which seemed to show conclusively what had happened that night. The execution took place as units of the Czechoslovak Legion, making their retreat out of Russia, approached Yekaterinburg. Fearing that the Legion would take the town and free him, the Emperor&#39;s Bolshevik jailers pursued the immediate liquidation of the Imperial Family, arguing that there was &quot;no turning back.&quot; [2] The telegram giving the order on behalf of the Supreme Soviet in Moscow was signed by Jacob Sverdlov, after whom the town was subsequently renamed. Nicholas was the first to die. He was executed with multiple bullets to the head and chest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The bodies of Nicholas and his family, after being soaked in acid and burned, were long believed to have been disposed of down a mineshaft at a site called the Four Brothers. Initially, this was true — they had indeed been disposed of there on the night of July 17. The following morning — when rumors spread in Yekaterinburg regarding the disposal site — Yurovsky removed the bodies and concealed them elsewhere. When the vehicle carrying the bodies broke down on the way to the next chosen site, Yurovsky made new arrangements, and buried most of the bodies in a sealed and concealed pit on Koptyaki Road, a cart track (now abandoned) 12 miles north of Yekaterinburg. Their remains were later found in 1991 and reburied by the Russian government following a state funeral. The process to identify the remains was exhaustive. Samples were sent to Britain and the United States for DNA testing. The tests concluded that five of the skeletons were members of one family and four were unrelated. Three of the five were determined to be the children of two parents. The mother was linked to the British royal family, as was Alexandra. The father was determined to be related to Grand Duke George Alexandrovich. British scientists said they were more than 98.5% sure that the remains were those of the Emperor, his family and their attendants. Relics from the Otsu Scandal (a failed assassination attempt on Tsesarevich Nicholas (future Nicholas II) in Japan) provided enough blood stains to make a negative identification possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A ceremony of Christian Burial was held in 1998, and the bodies were laid to rest with State honors in a special chapel in the Peter and Paul Fortress in St. Petersburg.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weak governments kill their enemies</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116741395714156001/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116741395714156001&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116741395714156001'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116741395714156001'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/execution-of-czar.html' title='The execution of the Czar'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116741214526921277</id><published>2006-12-29T11:05:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-29T12:09:06.393-05:00</updated><title type='text'>2007: the last year in Iraq</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/824656/Lieberman%20banner.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/290524/Lieberman%20banner.gif&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;I will crush the Mahdi Army&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Joe Lieberman has an op-ed in The Washington Post which is so filled with lies and errors that it is impossible to correct.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What he calls extremists led by Iran are the people who met with Bush this month, they&#39;re known as the Badr Organization. There are no moderates in power, no democrats. Just Hakim, Sadr and Sunni guerrillas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end, this is our last year in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What needs to be understood is that Iraq is in a civil war and the Sadrists are winning. Any US attempt to attack them not only could undermine any effort against Al Qaeda in Iraq, but place our supply lines in peril, starving and isolating our troops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Bush Administration has no plan for anything but doing the same. The idea of sending US troops into Sadr City should be called  negligent homicide at it&#39;s best. People like Lieberman believe that if we just get to work, we can crush the bad guys. Well, the &quot;bad guys&quot; aren&#39;t just an army but a social movement and they have the loyalty of millions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The inept recent attempt to isolate Sadr, kind of like trying to work past the IRA in 1919, failed before it started. Sistani said no dice. He may not like Sadr, but he likes the Americans even less, and Hakim showed his true colors sucking up to Bush. Which means he&#39;s for sale. He may have his Army formations, but I would bet when push comes to shove most of his guys would be loyal to Sayyid Sadr.  Why? Because when the Sunni death squads came, it was the Mahdi Army who showed up to save their families.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lieberman thinks we can win this war by relying on &quot;moderates&quot;. You mean people who live in London? Because the people running things in Iraq are pretty firm on their views of the  world. The fact is that this is our last year in Iraq, and Bush would do well to be in the Oval Office a year from now.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The US Army is close to collapse. Four tours borders on being assigned to punishment battalions. How many times can you send a man to die and expect him to come home alive?  What happens to his family, his life? Not much except a divorce and years of counselling.  Recruiters are now telling the most ridiculous lies to teenagers to get them to the Sandbox.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 109th Congress may be the worst Congress in American history.  And that would take some doing.  They failed their reposnibilties as a legislative body to find out the truth of our war in Iraq. They chose party over duty at every turn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 110th Congress will do no such thing. Just asking basic questions about the conduct of the war will expose it&#39;s failure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Lieberman thinks our army is made up of automations, the reality is that it is crumbling before our eyes. How many men have gone UA? How many are in Canada now? We don&#39;t know and the Army doesn&#39;t want to find out.  How many men have been chaptered out after a combat tour or two?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The destruction of the Army is slow, but visible. Death penalty murder trials, declining enlistment rates, divorce rates climbing. Reporters are just now asking these questions. What happens next. When is some happy talk colonel embarassed because his grunts have to gun down Iraqi soldiers drawing down on them or refuse one more pointless patrol.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re coming fast towards 1970 and the Army which stopped fighting. Humans can only take so much. The people who have enlisted have gone above and beyond what is expected of them. But that cannot continue. Bush&#39;s war will come to an end. When is no longer the issue. The only question is how.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116741214526921277/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116741214526921277&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116741214526921277'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116741214526921277'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/2007-last-year-in-iraq.html' title='2007: the last year in Iraq'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116740808927022282</id><published>2006-12-29T10:57:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-29T11:01:29.323-05:00</updated><title type='text'>New Orleans officers indicted for murder</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061229/2006_12_29t051510_450x301_us_neworleans_police_indictments.jpg?x=380&amp;y=253&amp;amp;sig=2w8wAgZkRCzY7Xgj5dec9Q--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061229/2006_12_29t051510_450x301_us_neworleans_police_indictments.jpg?x=380&amp;y=253&amp;amp;sig=2w8wAgZkRCzY7Xgj5dec9Q--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Lucas Jackson/Reuters)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-bridge29dec29,0,5329453.story?track=tottext&quot;&gt;New Orleans police officers face charges&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Danziger Bridge shooting incident, six days after Hurricane Katrina, left 2 dead and 4 seriously wounded.&lt;br /&gt;By Miguel Bustillo, Times Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;December 29, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;HOUSTON — A grand jury on Thursday indicted seven New Orleans police officers on murder and attempted murder charges for their role in a chaotic post-Katrina shooting that left two dead, including a mentally disabled man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The criminal charges against the officers, who had been cleared of any wrongdoing by the New Orleans Police Department, come after widespread public criticism of what has become known as the Danziger Bridge incident. The police shootings have, for many in the city, come to symbolize the lawlessness and disorder that marked the days after the hurricane.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;We cannot allow our police officers to shoot and kill our citizens without justification like rabid dogs,&quot; Orleans Parish Dist. Atty. Eddie J. Jordan Jr. said in a statement Thursday.&lt;/span&gt; &quot;The rules governing the use of lethal force are not suspended during a state of emergency. Everyone, including police officers, must abide by the law of the land.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Six days after Katrina hit New Orleans, police on Sept. 4, 2005, commandeered a truck and responded to what they initially reported as two officers down during an armed attack on the Danziger Bridge linking the Gentilly and New Orleans East neighborhoods.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the fusillade that followed, Ronald Madison, a 40-year-old mentally disabled man who had refused to leave his dogs during the storm, and James Brissette, 19, were killed. Four others were seriously wounded.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From the outset, the shooting&#39;s survivors have said that they were simply crossing the bridge and ran in panic only after a pack of men they thought were criminals opened fire for no apparent reason.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Follow-up media reports found that no officers had been wounded prior to the gunfire that killed Madison and Brissette, casting doubt on the officers&#39; version of events, which was backed by the department. An autopsy found that Madison was shot in the back several times, &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;contradicting a sergeant&#39;s claims that the man, who had no prior criminal record, had come toward the officers and reached into his waistband before being shot.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In response to public criticism, Jordan convened a special grand jury to examine evidence in the case. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;On Thursday, it indicted two sergeants, Kenneth Bowen and Robert Gisevius, and two officers, Anthony Villavaso and Robert Faulcon, on first-degree murder charges in Brissette&#39;s death. Faulcon also was charged with first-degree murder in the death of Madison. The charges carry a potential death sentence.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Will the Queens DA have the ability to make a similar decision?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116740808927022282/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116740808927022282&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116740808927022282'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116740808927022282'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/new-orleans-officers-indicted-for.html' title='New Orleans officers indicted for murder'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116737109331544558</id><published>2006-12-29T03:05:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-29T01:03:05.340-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The Winners of 2006</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/753934/howard.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/180871/howard.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, in no particular order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;You Tube &lt;/span&gt;Not only  did they sell out to Google before the lawsuits, it became a clever subversive tool to send video around the world. You could track campaigns because they could upload their ads.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sasha Baron Cohen&lt;/span&gt;-Borat was probably the slickest auteur act since Kevin Smith made Clerks. Not only is the movie incredibly funny, but he made his movie, his way and made fans along the way. It also is a brutal expose of racism in America without the preaching of American filmmakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Morgan Spurlock- &lt;/span&gt;30 Days was in some ways much better than Super Size Me, it proved that he was more than a one trick pony. Seeing people trying to live on minimum wage is compelling TV.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ned Lamont&lt;/span&gt;-No, he didn&#39;t win, but he proved you could run and run hard, and people tend to forget thatls possible&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Jon Stewart&lt;/span&gt;-At some point, maybe when he was interviewing Ted Koppel, the Daily Show crossed the last line between parody and news. Yeah, they still write jokes and we still laugh, but it has, in effect replaced Nightline for informed commentary. Stewart is my kind of guy, a no-bullshit, straight up questioner. He will not be subtle if he dislikes you or think you an idiot. Tucker Carlson and Bob Novak are still shocked that he really holds them in contempt, no bullshit, actual contempt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Stephen Colbert&lt;/span&gt;-When he got on the stage at the White House Correspondent&#39;s Dinner, they thought he was going to do one of those house nigger comedy routines comics like to do for the famous. Instead, he came out like a ninja, subtle, deadly and by the time he was finished, it was the verbal equivilent of the end of Kill Bill pt 1, blood and bodies everywhere. And at the end, Colbert walked off as if he had gone for a drink.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The two men are a very effective team. Stewart comes out swinging, when he finishes, you know you&#39;ve had your ass kicked. With Colbert, he&#39;s standing on you before you realize what happened. But the result is the same.  You got beat&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Keith Olbermann-&lt;/span&gt;He was famous before Stewart had a regular job. Aaron Sorkin had based a character on him on his show Sportsnite. He was renowned for being a pain in the ass around the industry.  Most of his employers were glad to see the back of him at some point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But his real problem is that he&#39;s smart, maybe too smart. He can smell the bullshit and then calls it. And that does not make you a hero with bosses. His last boss, Rick Kaplan, freaked when he went on his anti-smoking jihad after the death of Peter Jennings. If he could have, he would have consigned him to ESPN radio with Dan Patrick, his long time partner in crime. Replacing him with Dan Abrams gave Olbermann needed support while consigning Rita Crosby into the outer pits of hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, you can say two things about him, he is loyal to his crew, and he has balls. Maybe when he realized he wasn&#39;t going to be a network anchor, or maybe when he got the freedom to do what he wanted, something in him clicked. He stopped playing the game and invented his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which mean he had the freedom to go after that pompous asshole Bill O&#39;Reilly. At every turn, he fucks with him and does it for real. And unlike Terry Gross, he can&#39;t be bullied. At well over 6 feet, if O&#39;Reilly had the balls to step to him, he would get his ass kicked. Instead, he runs like the bitch he is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It wasn&#39;t that he did commentaries, but that he was informed. He mixed anger and information with outrage. There&#39;s always a risk of staging them, doing them for effect, feeling forced, but the one he did on 9/11 meant the most to me, because it was something only a New Yorker could say and could understand. Those buildings and the people in them were real, as real as grass and rain.  Not too many people got that. He did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Kirsten Gillibrand- &lt;/span&gt;Few candidates deserved to win more than she did. John Sweeney was an arrogant clown who thought he could bully newspapers. Instead, a candidate who might actually work for her district and not drink with frat boys will now serve them&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Joe Sestak-&lt;/span&gt; Well, he was the candidate who deserved to win even more. Curt Weldon was scum and may well be a crook. He attacked Sestak&#39;s sick five year old daughter. He deserved to lose. Badly. And he did.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Bob Menendez-&lt;/span&gt; They called him a crook when he wasn&#39;t. Even some inside the Democratic party wanted the seat held by someone different (white). But he ran hard and ran that prick Kean down like the dog he was.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Matt Stoller&lt;/span&gt;-Most of you don&#39;t know Matt, or have heard of him obliquely or through the mail list which does not exist, but let me tell you something, while the media calls Atrios and Kos, it&#39;s Matt Stoller doing the day in, day out work which makes a lot of what happens online possible. Matt&#39;s blog, MyDD, is the center of a lot of what happens online without people noticing it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Juan Melli and CT Blogger&lt;/span&gt;-They do the dirty work of local and state poliitcs, which will never lead to glory or riches, but is needed because if you think federal government has problems.....these guys are heroes to me&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Amanda Marcotte&lt;/span&gt;-There are a lot of female bloggers, there are a lot of good writers, but Amanda doesn&#39;t get credit for walking into Pandagon when Jesse Taylor went off to work for Ted Strickland. It&#39;s hard to take over someone else&#39;s idea and make it your own. She&#39;s got that forthright, honest, funny voice which needs to be heard more often and given more credit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;y&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Mike Stark&lt;/span&gt;-I know his antics embarassed some of you. Y&#39;all need a cup of shut the fuck up. Because he did what needed to be done, and what the Webb campaign hadn&#39;t the balls to do. He exposed a sitting US senator as a loon and put everything he had in it. And will get no reward, little praise. But he&#39;s the kind of citizen we need when facing someone as nuts as George Allen. He&#39;s a hero to me, because he decided to challenge a US senator with questions and words.&lt;br /&gt;And that takes balls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Howard Dean&lt;/span&gt;-Karl Rove would still be bossing around Denny Hastert if it wasn&#39;t for Dean.

The carriage was small, with tall windows and white curtains with silver fringe. Two solemn men sat atop it, guiding the horses, and Mr. Brown’s friends and associates and Harlem dignitaries walked alongside and behind it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hundreds who lined 125th Street outside the theater on a chilly, overcast afternoon cheered and applauded. Helicopters hovered. Photographers aimed their cameras from the surrounding rooftops. A guy hawked commemorative T-shirts for $10. Mr. Brown’s cries and exultations filled the street, blaring from one of his concert videos playing on a beat-up television mounted above a sign for Uptown Tattoos. A chant rose up: “James Brown! James Brown! James Brown!”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the theater’s doors finally opened, people began streaming in for a public viewing. They walked up a few stairs and stepped onto the red-carpeted stage, where Mr. Brown’s body lay in an open coffin, washed in white and gold stage lights. The coffin was made of 16-gauge steel with a gold paint finish. Mr. Brown was wearing a cobalt, sequined satin suit with white gloves and pointed silvery shoes. Loudspeakers played his breakthrough album, “Live at the Apollo,” recorded Oct. 24, 1962.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Women wearing veils approached. A man in a suit dropped to his knees and crossed his heart. One couple broke into a brief dance. “Right now,” Mr. Brown said on the loudspeakers, in a snippet of between-song banter, “I’m going to get up and do my thing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Brown did his thing yesterday: he put on a show. Throughout the day, thousands, perhaps tens of thousands, formed two lines on 125th Street outside the Apollo, one to its east and one to its west, each one filling up 125th Street, reaching the corner and then stretching for blocks up Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard and Frederick Douglass Boulevard, forming a giant U. Some had been waiting since midnight Wednesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We’re sending him out in the style he lived,” said Nellie Williams, 58, of Greer, S.C., who stood near the front of one line. “He was a man that had to be seen and heard.” She brought her daughter, and a copy of an oil painting her brother did of Mr. Brown, his pompadour perfectly teased, his shirt open, his smile wide. “I want to show my last respects for his last show in New York,” Ms. Williams added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Brown, 73, died of congestive heart failure early Monday in Atlanta. He was remembered, during a private ceremony for family and friends at the Apollo, and amid the lines of fans standing outside for the public viewing, as a singer, dancer, bandleader, funk pioneer, entrepreneur, black-pride icon and entertainer who many said transformed American pop music and African-American culture. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They closed the doors at 9:30 and had to turn people away. Thousands of people viewed the body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He was beloved, despite his antics, the drugs, the wives. No words meant more to Harlem than James Brown live at the Apollo.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116737759976014971/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116737759976014971&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116737759976014971'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116737759976014971'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/proper-sendoff.html' title='A proper sendoff'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116737691830913571</id><published>2006-12-29T02:12:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-29T02:21:58.343-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Saddam to be murdered this weekend</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/488974/noose.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/303854/noose.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/29/world/middleeast/29saddam.html?hp&amp;ex=1167454800&amp;amp;en=a3dac03398ba63af&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt; U.S. Is Told Hussein Hanging Seems Imminent&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By JAMES GLANZ&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 29, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Dec. 28 — Preparations for the execution of Saddam Hussein began taking on a sense of urgency late Thursday as American and Iraqi officials suggested that he could be hanged within a span of days rather than weeks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After upholding the death sentence against Mr. Hussein on Tuesday for the execution of 148 Shiite men and boys in 1982, an Iraqi appeals court ruled that he must be sent to the gallows within 30 days. But Mr. Hussein may not have even that long to live, officials said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A senior administration official said that the execution would probably not take place in the next 24 hours, but that the timing would be swift. “It may be another day or so,” the official said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another senior administration official said later Thursday night that Iraqi officials had told the White House to expect the execution on Saturday, Baghdad time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Iraq, where the Constitution requires that the Iraqi president and his two deputies sign all execution orders, officials said it was unlikely that legal formalities would stand in the way. The president, Jalal Talabani, had not received the documents by late Thursday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a government official familiar with the process said that little objection would be raised if the execution took place almost immediately. “Even if it happens tonight, no one is going to make an issue out of the procedure,” the official said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mowaffak al-Rubaie, the national security adviser, said there would be no advance notice of the execution because of fears that any announcement could set off violence. When asked who would be invited to attend the hanging, Mr. Rubaie said: “No television. No press. Nothing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said that the execution would be videotaped but that it was unlikely the tape would be released.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even with the security fears, there was little appetite among Iraqi officialdom to spare Mr. Hussein for much longer. “I hope the decision should be implemented very soon,” said Qasim Daoud, a former national security adviser. “Sooner is better because it sends a message that we are determined — we want to get ahead step by step to building a new Iraq, and these messages will help.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, after a flawed legal process, they plan to murder him in secret. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How......night and fogish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they&#39;re men enough to murder him, murder him before the world. If you think hanging is justice, why hide it?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is revenge, pure and simple. Saddam may well deserve it, but don&#39;t insult us by calling it justice. A trial in the Green Zone is little better than one in Gitmo. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you want to prove a man evil, you must use justice to do so, not a hanging in the night. This should have been in Europe, without the fear in Iraq, and he should be in UN custody, as befitting his many crimes. With the evidence before the world, in a process which could be trusted by everyone. Where the victims could testify without fear and the documents available to everyone.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush may celebrate this, but this is murder, pure and simple.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116737691830913571/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116737691830913571&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116737691830913571'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116737691830913571'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/saddam-to-be-murdered-this-weekend.html' title='Saddam to be murdered this weekend'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116736691953045819</id><published>2006-12-29T01:33:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-28T23:35:19.550-05:00</updated><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig6/kolko5.html&quot;&gt; Rumsfeld and the American Way of War&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by Gabriel Kolko&lt;br /&gt;.....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Rumsfeld: &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Rumsfeld is one of the most articulate advocates of the two major wars the U.S. has embarked upon since 2000, and he had earlier made it plain to George Bush when he took office as Secretary of Defense that he would be &quot;forward-leaning.&quot; September 11 was an opportunity to realize dreams of heroism and success. He and Vice-president Dick Cheney are soul mates, their careers have been intertwined, but Cheney seeks to keep out of the limelight and Rumsfeld adored the publicity that his cleverness attracted. He is best known for his desire to make the military both meaner and leaner, relying on high tech rather than manpower, and &quot;shock and awe&quot; became his slogan. But to do so, national defense spending, which had been stable in the 1990s, increased from $294 billion in 2000 to $536 billion in 2006, and as a percentage of the GNP it grew 37 percent from 2000 to 2006. All kinds of weapons, many the futuristic products of junk science concocted by well-placed manufacturers, were funded for eventual production – a dozen years being a short delivery time for many of them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumsfeld&#39;s military dream was technology-intensive, even more now than 40 years ago, and it failed abysmally in Iraq. Army manpower, however, was reduced and it was left unprepared in countless domains, under-funded and overstretched even before the Iraq war began. Since then its &quot;readiness&quot; in terms of available troops and equipment has only fallen precipitously. And while Rumsfeld made the Army his enemy, even the Air Force now has to cut manpower to raise funds for new equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He always premised his ambition, which various defense secretaries had attempted before him and failed, on the notion that the secret of military success was better and more weapons – &quot;more bang for the buck&quot; as an illustrious predecessor phrased it. More bucks also made the Pentagon requests that much more palatable to a pork-hungry Congress eager to increase spending in their districts. Politics and complex diplomacy never interested people like Rumsfeld, even after the abysmal failure of the Vietnam War. Delivering bad news, which meant serious assessments, was the best way not to advance in the hierarchy, and careerism was crucial to what people said. The name of the game was the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In both Afghanistan and Iraq he learned that realities were far more complex and he managed to shock and awe himself and the neoconservatives who shared his naïve assumptions. Reliance on high tech did not prevent warfare from becoming protracted, and it guaranteed that it would become far more costly. Both wars produced stalemates that have become the preludes to American defeats now staring the Bush administration in the face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumsfeld showed at various times that in certain ways he was a person of superior intelligence notwithstanding the basically erroneous premises of the military system he led and the imperatives of ambition that demanded he share them. But like his peers, he learned far too slowly. He suffered from the typical contradiction between intelligence and ambition, and the latter requires an ideology and assumptions which most men-of-power come to believe. He admitted in a confidential memo in October 2003 that &quot;we lack the metrics to know if we are winning or losing the global war on terror&quot;; even then key members of the Bush Administration were far less confident of what they are doing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His November 6, 2006 memo on the Iraq war admitted that &quot;what U.S. forces are currently doing in Iraq is not working well enough or fast enough.&quot; There are some anodynes he advocated too, but it was rightly interpreted as his concession to the Baker-Hamilton panel view, which is the voice of the traditional foreign policy Establishment, that the Iraq war was going disastrously – in effect, was being lost. Since then, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has declared there is a civil war raging in Iraq and there should be a drawdown of American troops, to begin by the middle of next year – a step that even Rumsfeld favored with modest withdrawals that would compel the Iraqis &quot;to pull up their socks.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rumsfeld and his peers know the American military cannot win the war in Iraq. Just as during the Vietnam war, they have the quixotic hope that a solution for the profound and bloody turmoil that reigns there can be found politically – at first the Shiites, Sunnis, and Kurds were to have parliamentary elections and then make a political deal. They did not. Then they were to write a constitution, which they eventually managed to do but it changed nothing. Now they are hoping that the prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, can miraculously cobble together some kind of consensus that will produce peace, but Bush&#39;s closest advisers think it is very likely he will fail. They have no one else to turn to. Politics, like military power, will not prevent the United States from losing control over events in Iraq – thereby losing the war. A &quot;surge&quot; in American troops in Iraq, as even the Joint Chiefs of Staff now argues, is only a recipe for greater disasters. Attacks against U.S. coalition forces, their Iraqi dependents, and civilians have now reached a peak and are over twice that two years ago. The Bush Administration today confronts disaster in Iraq, and probably the worst foreign policy failure in American history. Futility is the hallmark of all its efforts&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;....................</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116736691953045819/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116736691953045819&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116736691953045819'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116736691953045819'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/rumsfeld-and-american-way-of-war-by.html' title=''/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116736669981262449</id><published>2006-12-29T01:26:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-28T23:35:48.056-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Why I hate chickenhawks</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/764238/capt.jls10606181733.iraq_jls106.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/734039/capt.jls10606181733.iraq_jls106.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/12/27/193319/00&quot;&gt; The holidays have changed... &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by teachervet [Subscribe]&lt;br /&gt;Wed Dec 27, 2006 at 06:38:09 PM PST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Originally I intended to put up another post within a week or two, but two things caught me up: the usual pressures of teaching--grading papers, sending out reports, planning classes, dealing with bureaucratic nonsense--accompanied by a slipping back into a &quot;down time&quot; of my PTSD cycle. I learned to deal with the former early in my career; I&#39;m still learning to deal with the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entering the holidays is a tough time for combat-zone veterans. My VA counselor (who was expressing her concern for how I was going to manage it) said that it&#39;s a given that these vets more often than not struggle with holidays regardless of how much time has passed. Fortunately, I didn&#39;t have go out to do any shopping (my wife tries to steer me away from crowds anyway, and I&#39;ve made good use of the &#39;net), and family is too far away to visit. Although I love Midnight Mass, I knew the crowded church would be difficult, so I skipped that. I avoided all the holiday tripe on TV. And I have a family that loves me understands this condition. So I made it through Christmas pretty well--I even enjoyed most of it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have been able to take some time to reflect on the holidays in light of my experiences, and so that will be the topic of this (long) post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The central problem that I and other vets seem to have with the holidays is an extension of the feeling of dislocation. That&#39;s not to say that specific events don&#39;t trigger other responses, though. In my group meeting last week, all of spoke of us avoiding shopping malls and parties. Crowded malls are awful; there&#39;s too much activity. In a combat zone, one learns very quickly to always be taking in the surroundings for signs of danger: &quot;on alert.&quot; The worst place to be is someplace crowded, for who can watch every face, every look, every movement, every corner, every rooftop? It puts the brain on overload, and triggers the fight or flight response. When I visited a mall last year shortly before Christmas, I lasted about 20 minutes and then left shaking, soaked in sweat, and nauseous. (It was after that experience that I finally agreed to start taking medication for anxiety attacks.) Although I&#39;ve gotten a lot better over the past year--I can manage the mall on quieter days--it&#39;s nothing I want to push.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Parties, including family get-togethers, are also a problem. Happily, I&#39;m past the partying age, and my closest family is 1500 miles away, so it&#39;s not a major issue for me. But I listen to other vets, particularly the younger ones in my therapy group, and parties seem recipes for disaster, especially if there&#39;s alcohol or other substances around. Most of us seem to go through a period of &quot;self-medicating&quot; after we come back. As we all know, alcohol &amp; drugs provided that temporary escape that someone who&#39;s experienced trauma craves. Of course, these also have depressive qualities, so at best they push the vet deeper into his or her depression and anxiety. Worse, with the lowered inhibitions, the anger that most of us carry inside comes closer to the surface, and any little thing can trigger a violent response. One member of my group remarked about how just having his personal space invaded by being bumped sets him off. Another told about the &quot;stupid questions&quot; (this is a category vets are familiar with), like &quot;did you kill anyone?&quot; or even &quot;what was it like?&quot; would send him into a rage. Some are able to walk away or go off in a quiet corner and accept another ruined social event; others wind up in verbal or physical fights that never turn out well. (I&#39;m the only one in the group who hasn&#39;t been in jail.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I imagine, though, that these issues make sense to those who at least try to understand what a combat-zone veteran is trying to deal with. However, what I&#39;ve found the most difficult to come to terms with is more existential. The effects of the physical and emotional changes one undergoes are amplified by the resulting sense of not belonging anywhere. I know that I didn&#39;t belong in the Iraq war--and that I&#39;ll not go back under any circumstances--but having been there, I don&#39;t feel a part of this world either. My friends and colleagues treat me differently, either as someone who did something heroic (which is annoying because I didn&#39;t) or as the &quot;emotionally wounded veteran&quot; (which is depressing because I guess I am). I can&#39;t really talk about my experiences to either group; I&#39;m not even sure they really want to hear about them. This has been true since the day my plane landed back here in the States, not just in December. The holidays, though, seem to have the effect of lemon juice on a cut, aggravating what can often just be ignored. Seeing everyone getting caught up in the &quot;holiday mood&quot; while you can&#39;t underscores how cut-off you still are.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most pervasive feeling is one of &quot;people just don&#39;t get it.&quot; Some of it&#39;s personal: &quot;How can everyone be happy when I feel like sh--?&quot; But it&#39;s also more general: &quot;Don&#39;t people know there&#39;s a war going on? That right this moment someone&#39;s dying?&quot; I doubt many of us begrudge anyone happiness and the normal banality of life--it&#39;s what so many of us long for--but from many of our perspectives, our society seems especially cold and unfeeling at the holidays. I&#39;ve spoken with many vets from Vietnam up to Iraq &amp; Afghanistan who express how much they dislike holidays because people seem so unaffected by, even indifferent to, what has been for us a life-changing event.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve found it easier to cope with these thoughts this year. I know from my public speaking that many people really do care about this war, and to cast them as cold &amp;amp; indifferent is simply a projection of my own anger, frustration, and hurt. What I think I will always have a problem with is the hypocrisy this season brings into focus. As a practicing Christian (of the Catholic persuasion), the Christmas holiday has always been a reminder of our shared humanity, of the imperative to love one another, of the call to work for peace and justice. The warm &amp; cuddly Christmas of the past has been replaced, for me, by a more immediate, anxious, activist Christmas; a prophetic call to work against the forces of  chaos, destruction and brutality that seem to occupy positions of governmental and corporate power. That so many of my brother and sister Christians can celebrate this holiday and still feel unmoved to take action to end the suffering that this war (and all the others) has caused is deeply disturbing.  It has certainly tested my Christianity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On a final note, I&#39;d like to thank everyone who posted comments to my last (&amp;amp; first) entry. I wish I could respond to all, but time doesn&#39;t permit. I did, however, read them all, and very, very much appreciate the kindness they expressed. It does matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I take it back: one more comment. Several people asked why I haven&#39;t identified myself on either this blog or my website. The answer is simply this--that there are those whose opinions differ from mine, but who are unwilling to engage in civil discourse. I, and my family, have been verbally attacked in person and online with hateful, abusive, and threatening comments. I&#39;ve even had people with whom I served try to smear me with hateful distortions and untruths. I&#39;m choosing for now to avoid these as much as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, thank you all, and let&#39;s all hope and/or pray for a resolution to this war in 2007.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Peace!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let Misha, Captain Ed, Instacracker and the rest of those assholes trade places with this guy for a day and see if they would spout the same bullshit. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I serious doubt it</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116736669981262449/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116736669981262449&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116736669981262449'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116736669981262449'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/why-i-hate-chickenhawks.html' title='Why I hate chickenhawks'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116736829792139475</id><published>2006-12-29T01:15:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-28T23:58:18.120-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Suicide over Iraq</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/443125/capt.sge.ejb57.180605024715.photo00.photo.default-384x272.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/911648/capt.sge.ejb57.180605024715.photo00.photo.default-384x272.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/26/AR2006122601033.html&quot;&gt;Reservist Due for Iraq Is Killed in Standoff With Police&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Megan Greenwell&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, December 27, 2006; Page B02&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Army Reservist James E. Dean had already served 18 months in Afghanistan when he was notified three weeks ago that he would be deployed to Iraq later this month. The prospect of returning to war sent the St. Mary&#39;s County resident into a spiral of depression, a neighbor said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despondent about his orders, Dean barricaded himself inside his father&#39;s home with several weapons on Christmas, threatening to kill himself. After a 14-hour standoff with authorities, Dean was killed yesterday by a police officer after he aimed a gun at another officer, police said.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Wanda Matthews, who lives next door to Dean&#39;s father and said she thought of the younger man as a son, described him as a &quot;very good boy.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;His dad told me that he didn&#39;t want to go to war,&quot; Matthews said. &quot;He had already been out there and didn&#39;t want to go again.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dean, 29, was shot once after a confrontation with officers that began when a member of Dean&#39;s family asked police to check on him about 10 p.m. Monday, police said. Dean stated his intention to kill himself several times late that night and yesterday morning and had fired at officers multiple times, St. Mary&#39;s County Sheriff Tim Cameron said. A handful of bullets hit police cars, but no officers were injured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Say ONE fucking word to me about how we need to leave the Bush girls alone, I will smash your teeth down your fucking throat.  I don&#39;t want to hear it any more. Bush should be asked every day, so should Tony Snow, that if this war is so important, why is not one member of the Bush family bearing ANY burden. In fact, the State Department has to cover for &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;them.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;reservist&lt;/span&gt; on a &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;second&lt;/span&gt; tour.

They say a surge in troop levels some people are calling for is a bad idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;President Bush is considering increasing the number of troops in Iraq and embedding more U.S. advisers in Iraqi units. White House advisers have indicated Bush will announce his new plan for the war before his State of the Union address Jan. 23.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In dozens of interviews with soldiers of the Army&#39;s 5th Battalion, 20th Infantry Regiment as they patrolled the streets of eastern Baghdad, many said the Iraqi capital is embroiled in civil warfare between majority Shiite Muslims and Sunni Arabs that no number of American troops can stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Others insisted current troop levels are sufficient and said any increase in U.S. presence should focus on training Iraqi forces, not combat.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But their more troubling worry was that dispatching a new wave of soldiers would result in more U.S. casualties, and some questioned whether an increasingly muddled American mission in Baghdad is worth putting more lives on the line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Spc. Don Roberts, who was stationed in Baghdad in 2004, said the situation had gotten worse because of increasing violence between Shiites and Sunnis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I don&#39;t know what could help at this point,&quot; said Roberts, 22, of Paonia, Colo. &quot;What would more guys do? We can&#39;t pick sides. It&#39;s almost like we have to watch them kill each other, then ask questions.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based in Fort Lewis, Wash., the battalion is part of the 3rd Stryker Brigade Combat Team of the 2nd Infantry Division. Deployed in June, its men were moved to Baghdad from Mosul in late November to relieve another Stryker battalion that had reached the end of its tour.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Nothing&#39;s going to help. It&#39;s a religious war, and we&#39;re caught in the middle of it,&quot; said Sgt. Josh Keim, a native of Canton, Ohio, who is on his second tour in Iraq. &quot;It&#39;s hard to be somewhere where there&#39;s no mission and we just drive around.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capt. Matt James, commander of the battalion&#39;s Company B, was careful in how he described the unit&#39;s impact since arriving in Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The idea in calling us in was to make things better here, but it&#39;s very complicated and complex,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But James said more troops in combat would likely not have the desired effect. &quot;The more guys we have training the Iraqi army the better,&quot; he said. &quot;I would like to see a surge there.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During a recent interview, Lt. Gen. Nasier Abadi, deputy chief of staff for the Iraqi army, said that instead of sending more U.S. soldiers, Washington should focus on furnishing his men with better equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We are hoping 2007 will be the year of supplies,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some in the 5th Battalion don&#39;t think training will ever get the Iraqi forces up to American standards.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;They&#39;re never going to be as effective as us,&quot; said 1st Lt. Sean McCaffrey, 24, of Shelton, Conn. &quot;They don&#39;t have enough training or equipment or expertise.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116735814777133829/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116735814777133829&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116735814777133829'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116735814777133829'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/no-more-troops.html' title='No more troops'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116732403206948559</id><published>2006-12-28T11:01:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-28T11:40:33.513-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Losers of 2006</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/688761/blackwell_ad.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/54228/blackwell_ad.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Well, he was right enough to win&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ok, we&#39;re doing our year end series on winners and losers&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s start with the losers in no particular order&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Karl Rove&lt;/span&gt;- Once the king of Washington.

When it did, Bush didn&#39;t take it too well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George H.W. Bush&lt;/span&gt;- Your family lies shattered. Your second oldest son is headed for a University presidency, your oldest son rejects your counsel like you&#39;re a doddering old man, your grandchildren suck.

It wasn&#39;t.&lt;br /&gt;Which is why Sen. Cardin will be going to Washington and Bush won&#39;t hire you. They want you to shuck and jive on TV. Good luck with that, Simple Sambo.

Funny as hell. Too bad they never directly tied Lieberman to Bush. You know, for the better part of a year, Kos defended you to the DC insiders, claiming you were blackballed because you were too clever. Well, you are, too clever by half.  Your commericals were great on You Tube, but Ned Lamont should get his money back. Why? Because while you were playing cute and talking to the internet over the voters, the Menendez campaign and DSCC ran a simple ad campaign against Tom Kean, Jr.  Kean=Bush.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which is why Sen. Menendez kept his seat and your guy lost. How in the fuck could you let Lieberman say he was against the war. Crashing cars doesn&#39;tr refute that, black and white ads don&#39;t refute that. Only tying Bush to Lieberman, which should have been as simple as tying your shoe, would have done that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Ken Mehlman&lt;/span&gt;-Wow, where to begin, the black candidates, the race baiting ads, the gay GOP underground?

How many of your handpicked candidates won? Tammy Duckworth? How much money did you toss after her?

Badly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Lincoln Chaffee&lt;/span&gt;-You had to know you were going to lose, right. You could have switched parties and had that seat for life. Now, it&#39;s Sen. Whitehouse. Well, maybe they&#39;ll let you run the Smithsonian or something.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The loser of the year: George Allen&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;When you started out 2006, people were talking about you running for president. When it ended, you faced legal action from a law student.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What simply happened is that the truth came out. You are a racist. Not by birth, but by choice. People no longer lied for you. And the truth is, Jim Webb barely ran a race until the end. He had funding issues, personality issues, support issues. But he&#39;s Sen. Webb and you&#39;re a bum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Macaca.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You called that boy a nigger and got caught. Simple as that. Just for filming you. You tried to be cute about it, but there was nothing cute about Macaca which translates nicely into nigger.

It was pocked with bullet holes and bore fake license plates. The trunk had cases of unused sniper bullets and a notice to a Shiite family telling them to abandon their home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Otherwise, your rotten heads will be cut off,” the note read.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The soldiers who came upon the car in a Sunni neighborhood in Baghdad were part of a joint American and Iraqi patrol, and the Americans were ready to take action. The Iraqi commander, however, taking orders by cellphone from the office of a top Sunni politician, said to back off: the car’s owner was known and protected at a high level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Maj. William Voorhies, the American commander of the military training unit at the scene, the moment encapsulated his increasingly frustrating task — trying to build up Iraqi security forces who themselves are being used as proxies in a spreading sectarian war. This time, it was a Sunni politician — Vice Prime Minister Salam al-Zubaie — but the more powerful Shiites interfered even more often.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;“I have come to the conclusion that this is no longer America’s war in Iraq, but the Iraqi civil war where America is fighting,” Major Voorhies said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A two-day reporting trip accompanying Major Voorhies’s unit and combat troops seemed to back his statement, as did other commanding officers expressing similar frustration.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I have personally witnessed about a half-dozen of these incidents of what I would call political pressure, where a minister or someone from a minister’s office contacts one of these Iraqi commanders,” said Lt. Col. Steven Miska, the deputy commander for the Dagger Brigade Combat Team, First Infantry Division, who oversees combat operations in a wide swath of western Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“These politicians are connected with either the militias or Sunni insurgents.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whatever plan the Bush administration unveils — a large force increase, a withdrawal or something in between — this country’s security is going to be left in the hands of Iraqi forces. Those forces, already struggling with corruption and infiltration, have shown little willingness to stand up to political pressure, especially when the Americans are not there to support them. That suggests, the commanders say, that if the Americans leave soon, violence will redouble. And that makes their mission, Major Voorhies and Colonel Miska say, more important than ever.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They added that while political pressure on the Iraqi Army is great, the influence exerted on the police force, which is much more heavily infiltrated by Shiite militia groups, is even greater.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shiites, led by militia forces and often aided by the local police, are clearly ascendant, Colonel Miska said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It seems very controlled and deliberate and concentrated on expanding the area they control,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Sunni forces are being bolstered by support from insurgent strongholds in the West. The Shiite militias are using neighborhoods in the north, specifically Shuala and Sadr City, as bases of operation. There is also increasing evidence that militia members from southern cities like Basra are coming to Baghdad to join the fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I believe everyone, to some extent, is influenced by the militias,” Colonel Miska said. “While some Iraqi security forces may be complicit with the militias, others fear for their families when confronting the militia, and that is the more pervasive threat.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at a map he had his intelligence officers create, which highlights current battle zones and details the changing religious makeup of neighborhoods, Colonel Miska noted just how many different forces, each answering to different bosses, currently occupied the battlefield.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116728351149795620/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116728351149795620&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116728351149795620'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116728351149795620'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/your-iraqi-army.html' title='Your Iraqi Army'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116728228063713675</id><published>2006-12-28T00:07:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-28T00:11:11.280-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Dumb as a box of rocks</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/878103/sedimentarybox1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/414162/sedimentarybox1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,1979111,00.html&quot;&gt;Washington gets ready to gossip as DC sex blog goes to court&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dan Glaister in Los Angeles&lt;br /&gt;Thursday December 28, 2006&lt;br /&gt;The Guardian&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Washington Post described Jessica Cutler as &quot;our blog slut&quot;. The National Enquirer opined that she was &quot;beautiful, untalented and morally corrupted&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now the blogger who wrote about her attempts to juggle affairs with six men while keeping a job as an aide to a senator has a new role: as the star defendant in a case that could help define what can and cannot be published in a blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Writing under the pseudonym Washingtonienne, Cutler described in detail the sexual intricacies of her life on the Hill. The blog, which Cutler claimed was intended to keep her friends up to date on her social life in Washington DC, achieved notoriety, and its author fame and a book contract, after it was brought to a wider public by another blog, Wonkette.&lt;br /&gt;....................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While Cutler lost her job with Republican senator Mike DeWine, Mr Steinbuch moved to a teaching post in Arkansas and filed a lawsuit alleging invasion of privacy and seeking $20m (£10.1m) in damages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr Steinbuch&#39;s attorney, Jonathan Rosen, told a judge in a pre-trial hearing that his client, who teaches in Arkansas, wants to restore his good name. &quot;It&#39;s not funny and it&#39;s damaging,&quot; Mr Rosen said. &quot;It&#39;s horrible, absolutely horrible.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cutler&#39;s attorney, Matthew Billips, had a different view: &quot;I have no idea what he wants,&quot; he said. &quot;He&#39;s never said, &#39;This is what I think should be done.&#39;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The judge, too, seemed bemused by the case. &quot;I don&#39;t know why we&#39;re here in federal court to begin with,&quot; Judge Paul Friedman told attorneys in April. &quot;I don&#39;t know why this guy thought it was smart to file a lawsuit and lay out all of his private, intimate details.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why is this a case? He&#39;s going to be humiliated, while Cutler could give a shit. She&#39;s admitted to being a whore, so what&#39;s left? He, otoh, could lose his reputation.&lt;br /&gt;Idiot.

That, however, has also been designated as the weekend for FA Cup semi-finals and, if either club make it to that stage, the league game will be postponed until the final week of the season, with May 8 or 9 the most likely dates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Article continues&lt;br /&gt;Sky is acutely aware of the interest that would exist around such a match and the possibility has already been floated of rearranging the fixture with the intention of recreating a game that will have similarities to Arsenal&#39;s visit to Liverpool in May 1989 - when Michael Thomas&#39;s last-minute goal sent the title to Highbury on goal difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Premier League confirmed last night that it is a &quot;possibility&quot; but for now, at least, it remains dependent not only on United or Chelsea progressing to the last four of the FA Cup but on them still being within touching distance of each other in April. United are currently four points ahead after the Boxing Day fixtures, when United overcame Wigan 3-1 while Chelsea could manage only a 2-2 draw at home to Reading.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;United also have a far superior goal difference, having scored 44 goals and conceded 11 in their 20 league games. Chelsea have scored 35 with 15 conceded and Ferguson felt sufficiently emboldened yesterday to predict that the 13-goal advantage would not be clawed back and effectively counted as another point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The goal difference helps us,&quot; said the United manager. &quot;There is no doubt about that. I have always believed that 10 or 12 goals makes up another point and, if it remains that way, it is something we will have to fall back on. Hopefully we won&#39;t have to but it is there anyway.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ferguson believes that Chelsea, despite their recent problems, still have the strength in depth to sustain a challenge for the remainder of the season but he has said more than once that he will be happy for it to go down to the final week of the season and a &quot;photo-finish&quot;.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116728250040591846/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116728250040591846&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116728250040591846'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116728250040591846'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/red-devils-vs-blues-for-season-final.html' title='Red Devils vs Blues for season final'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116727370837577293</id><published>2006-12-28T00:06:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-27T21:41:48.966-05:00</updated><title type='text'>How the right lies about history again</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/299809/133sqdn.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/977538/133sqdn.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Americans serving in 133 Squadron,1941&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://mediamatters.org/items/200612220010&quot;&gt; Only on Fox: Panel discussed video of &quot;Rep. Ancy Lagosi&quot; attacking FDR during WWII&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The &quot;All-Star Panel&quot; segment on the December 21 edition of Fox News&#39; Special Report contained a clip from This Is DNN, a &quot;satirical video&quot; in which World War II-era &quot;Congresswoman and House leader Ancy Lagosi&quot; attacks the war and then-President Franklin D. Roosevelt. In the segment of This Is DNN that aired on Special Report, &quot;Lagosi&quot; says that &quot;250,000 of our finest [have come] home in wooden boxes ... [t]o support a lie.&quot; When &quot;Lagosi&quot; asks, &quot;What has Germany and Italy got to do with Pearl Harbor?&quot; the audience at her speech responds, &quot;Nothing!&quot; and then chants, &quot;Roosevelt lied, millions died.&quot; Special Report host and Fox News Washington bureau managing editor Brit Hume described the film as &quot;filled with sepia-toned scenes from ... what purports to be an old newsreel of modern-style coverage of World War II.&quot; He then asked the panel, &quot;[I]s that a realistic picture of what it might have been like if today&#39;s politics and today&#39;s news media coverage had prevailed in World War II?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As panelist and Roll Call executive editor Morton Kondracke noted during the discussion, Adolf Hitler&#39;s Germany, an ally of Japan, declared war on the United States after the United States declared war against Japan on December 8, 1941. The United States then declared war against Germany as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Is DNN: What if Today&#39;s Media Covered WWII was produced by Clear Glass Productions and featured at the recent 2006 Liberty Film Festival, which, as Media Matters for America has noted, is meant to &quot;provid[e] a forum in the heart of Hollywood for conservative and libertarian filmmakers.&quot; At the festival, ABC Vice President of Synergy and Special Projects Judith Tukich was presented with the festival&#39;s &quot;Freedom of Expression Award&quot; for her role in assisting the production and promotion of the factually challenged ABC &quot;docudrama&quot; The Path to 9/11. The screenwriter of The Path to 9/11, Cyrus Nowrasteh, an outspoken conservative, was also given a &quot;Freedom of Expression Award.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This Is DNN has been promoted on right-wing weblogs, including Little Green Footballs and Michelle Malkin&#39;s Hot Air. On November 20, Malkin featured This Is DNN in the first edition of Hot Air at the Movies, a series she said showcased &quot;conservative and anti-jihad documentarians and film producers.&quot; The film is also being sold on the book service of the right-wing magazine World Net Daily.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These fucking assclowns so want to drape themselves in the mantle of WWII over and over with no understanding of what they represent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are NOT the men who went to Canada and England to fight the Germans, they are the American Firsters who refused to support Britain in 1940. If Charles Lindburgh had not let the cat slip out of the bag with his speech in 1940, this line of thinking would have been deemed credible to this day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is almost amusing to hear these people chatter about sacrifice when they have done nothing for the cause they support.  They act as if their words would mean as much as taking your ass on a train to Montreal and then taking a ship on U-Boat infested seas to wind up buring to death over the English Channel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Instead, they would be like the Afriakaaners, who sabotaged their own country during the war. Or the cowardly Joseph Kennedy, eager to bow before the Germans.  They would be the ones wondering why we&#39;re fighting Hitler.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Germans has a name for these kinds of people &quot;Golden Pheasants&quot;. They sat in their office in their party uniforms, screeching about how the war should be fought. When Ivan and the boys came knocking, they couldn&#39;t run fast enough.  Pick up a gun? Nope. Tell other people how to die? Sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But they no longer live in Berlin, but in Washington and sit at think tank desks</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116727370837577293/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116727370837577293&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116727370837577293'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116727370837577293'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/how-right-lies-about-history-again.html' title='How the right lies about history again'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116724681878774138</id><published>2006-12-27T14:03:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-27T14:13:38.973-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Why Gerald Ford matters</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061227/2006_12_27t135423_450x307_us_ford.jpg?x=380&amp;y=259&amp;amp;sig=3ypED0l2nvYqt2DBhPfYqg--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061227/2006_12_27t135423_450x307_us_ford.jpg?x=380&amp;y=259&amp;amp;sig=3ypED0l2nvYqt2DBhPfYqg--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a President, he was mediocre.

The US military was dysfunctional, American society was shattered, there was a real question if the US could have survived the trial of Richard Nixon for his various crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once he had slunk off, to everyone&#39;s relief, there was no great appetite for punishment among Congress.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, by pardoning Nixon, he helped save the GOP, by not exposing the criminal nature of that enterprise.  It was allowed to reform as a right wing party, catering to small business and backwoods rednecks. The Dems never really pressed the advantage they could have had by exposing Nixon and his crimes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Such bloodletting ends more like the movie Z than in heroic triumph.

Some people may be wondering whence the idea sprang, and whether it’s a good one. The answer to the first question supplies the answer to the second.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The idea was &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cfr.org/publication.html?id=7861&quot;&gt;first floated&lt;/a&gt; in a February, 2005 Los Angeles Times op-ed column by neoconservative Nostradamus Max Boot. Boot, a dogged proponent of American Empire who regards Rudyard Kipling as the premier foreign policy thinker of the modern age, suggested modeling the new enterprise after the French Foreign Legion — he dubbed it the “Freedom Legion” — in what must surely be the only recorded instance of a neoconservative publicly offering anything remotely resembling praise for that most obstinate of nations.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;As you might expect from the source, it’s an unequivocally &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.democraticunderground.com/articles/05/03/04_boot.html&quot;&gt;bad idea&lt;/a&gt; on any number of levels, as is the practice of basing one’s Grand Strategy &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.btcnews.com/btcnews/1112&quot;&gt;on Kipling&lt;/a&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Recruiting from among our own citizens and legal residents is tres expensive. The Congressional Budget office estimated a few years ago that adding 20,000 troops to the Army would cost $100 billion in the first five years and $10 billion annually after that, which numbers you can mulitply to account for many more troops and the difficulty of training and commanding a corps of soldiers for whom English might be a second, third or unknown language. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;While we probably can find any number of willing recruits overseas, we might possibly encounter some resistance from local populations who hold both our government and its various military adventures in less than high regard, and from governments that may balk at the idea of US military training for those among their own citizenry who might eventually return to use that training against those governments. So, to the expense of recruiting, training, maintaining and commanding the Freedom Legion you can add that of protecting the recruiters and recruits in the far-flung lands we attempt to mine, exhaustively screening recruits to forestall the inevitable attempts to obtain the best military training in the world by people who wish us ill, and bribing the host governments into allowing us to do this.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Beyond the practical difficulties, which would be enough to scuttle the plan in any sane country, recruiting abroad would indelibly stamp the United States as an empire in official thought and deed. Boot thinks that’s a fine idea; one of his favorite Kipling quotes is “Ye dare not stoop to less,” from, appropriately, &lt;em&gt;The White Man’s Burden&lt;/em&gt;. He once said of the US imperative to take up that burden that “Afghanistan and other troubled lands today cry out for the sort of enlightened foreign administration once provided by self-confident Englishmen in jodhpurs and pith helmets.”&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And that, really, is all you need know about Max Boot and his ideas of what’s good for this country. &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a horrible idea and illegal in many countries. I doubt Mexico will welcome this with open arms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oh yeah, how do their get their benefits if they are wounded overseas? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Horrible on every level.

No further appeals are possible, and his final legal recourse appears to be a clause in the Constitution stating that the Iraqi president must approve all death sentences.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That clause offers Mr. Hussein only the slenderest of hopes. Jalal Talabani, the Iraqi president, has said he is formally against the death penalty, but he has permitted the hangings of many Iraqis convicted of capital crimes. And the Constitution may be trumped by an article in the charter of the tribunal stating that its sentences may be commuted by no one, not even the president.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The appeals verdict, covering one case involving the execution of 148 men and boys in the northern town of Dujail in 1982, came even as Mr. Hussein was facing trial on charges that he ordered the killing of tens of thousands of Kurds, whose bodies have in some instances been exhumed from grisly mass graves and minutely described in the courtroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The decision of the nine-judge appeals court was announced on short notice by the chief judge, Aref Shahen, after another day of the numbing violence that has gradually engulfed this country after the bursts of optimism that followed Mr. Hussein’s fall from power in March 2003 and his capture by American forces in December of that year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Judge Shahen delivered the verdict to a few reporters assembled at the Council of Ministers building within the heavily guarded Green Zone as the rest of the country settled into its nighttime curfew. There were none of the theatrical outbursts contrived by Mr. Hussein to disrupt the trial and the appeal, because he was not present to hear the verdict.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This should have been done under the International Criminal Court in Holland. Not in the Green Zone, so there would be no question as to the verdict. Now? Just drop him in Sadr City and be done with it.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116720428193622857/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116720428193622857&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116720428193622857'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116720428193622857'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/shia-kurds-to-murder-hussein-in.html' title='Shia, Kurds to murder Hussein in revenge'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116720363510683217</id><published>2006-12-27T02:11:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-27T02:14:03.533-05:00</updated><title type='text'>It would be funny if it wasn&#39;t true</title><content type='html'>&lt;h2&gt;           &lt;a class=&quot;post-title&quot; href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/12/26/baaaad-bosses-and-what-we-can-do-about-them/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent Link to Baaaad Bosses.

Lots of folks have good jobs with good pay, but an increasing number have good jobs with good pay and poor working conditions.  The numbers suggest that the job market is healthy and robust.… The stories that people tell about the way they work are discordant notes in the gleeful song of prosperity and success.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;The Bad Boss Contest is a lot of fun and highlights how far we still must go to improve the nation’s workplaces. But Working America doesn’t stop at just pointing out injustice at the workplace.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Since it was created in 2003, the organization has signed up more than 1.5 million members—and has done so by sending canvassers door to door, day after day in middle- and working-class neighborhoods where people are hungry to become part of a dynamic movement in which they can take action and make a difference.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Working America enables workers who do not have the benefit of a union on the job to join forces with 9 million union members in the AFL-CIO to work for good jobs, health care, retirement security and more.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;The majority of Working America members identify themselves as politically moderate&lt;font&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;(54 percent), and 32 percent own guns. But when Working America canvassers come to their doors and discuss how the policies of the Bush administration affect them and their families, they make the connection—and divisive social issues like abortion and gay marriage that may have impacted their vote fade when compared with the benefits of voting your pocketbook.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;In the 2006 elections, Working America membership translated into big-time political action, with members being instrumental in the union movement’s get-out-the-vote efforts. More than 400,000 Working America members live in the 20 congressional districts that were considered the highest priority House races.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Election night polling by Peter D. Hart Research Associates showed that 80 percent of Working America members who had not voted in 2002 said they turned out to vote this year. Non-2002 Working America voters supported Democratic candidates for Senate by 80 percent to 20 percent; non-2002 voters supported Democratic House candidates by 77 percent to 23 percent.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;In the union movement’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.aflcio.org/2006/11/06/final-four-report-from-the-field/&quot;&gt;“Final Four”&lt;/a&gt; days of the election, Working America members knocked on 153,000 doors in Ohio, Pennsylvania and Minnesota in a final push to get out the vote.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Working America members are joined in an online community where they regularly vote on the issues that most concern them, issues like health care they want Working America to focus on. Working America members can get free workplace advice through Working America’s Ask a Lawyer option. And they can access Job Tracker, which &lt;font&gt;provides data on job exporting and health and safety records of 250,000 employers in a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; huge database that indicates where jobs have been outsourced in their communities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Through regular e-mail updates, Working America members take action throughout the year.

Working America members generated 724 letters to state legislators supporting the bill, which was signed by Gov. Christine Gregoire (D). The state leave act is necessary because the Bush administration’s Labor Department recently has been threatening to gut the federal &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aflcio.org/issues/jobseconomy/workersrights/rightsatwork_e/fam.cfm&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);&quot;&gt;Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which allows workers to take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for a personal illness, to care for an ill family member or to care for a new baby.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:85%;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;Bad bosses don’t just happen.

As always, he professed little worry about his legacy or the polls. As always, he said the United States would win in Iraq. The nation might despair, but not Mr. Bush; his presidential armor seemed firmly intact.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet a longtime friend of Mr. Bush’s recently spotted a tiny crack in that armor. “He looked tired, for the first time, which I hadn’t seen before,” this friend said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Bush has never been one for introspection, in public or in private. But the questions of how the president is coping, and whether his public pronouncements match what he feels as he searches for a new strategy in Iraq, have been much on the minds of Bush-watchers these days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Can the president really believe, as he said on Wednesday, that “victory in Iraq is achievable,” when a bipartisan commission led by his own father’s secretary of state calls the situation there “grave and deteriorating?” Is he truly content to ignore public opinion and let “the long march of history,” as he calls it, pass judgment on him after he is gone? Does he lie awake at night, as President Lyndon B. Johnson did during the Vietnam War, fretting over his decisions?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Bush addressed the sleep issue in a recent interview with People magazine, saying, “I’m sleeping a lot better than people would assume.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet the president can never really escape the rigors of his job, Laura Bush, the first lady, said in an interview on Sunday on the CBS news program “Face the Nation.” “Sure, he lives with it, 24 hours a day,” Mrs. Bush said. “You don’t have his job and not live with it 24 hours a day.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But as to whether he second-guesses himself, Mr. Bush gives little quarter, reducing such inquiries to the broad-brush question of whether it was correct to topple Saddam Hussein. Nor does the president seem to question his handling of the postwar period.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His friend, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Bush still believed that Donald H. Rumsfeld “did a great job over all” as the secretary of defense, despite the president’s decision to replace him after Democrats swept the November elections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I think he knows it’s bad over there,” this person said, “but I’m not quite sure he fully appreciates the incompetence of what’s gone on.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I was watching this White House Christmas special last night, and after a couple of minutes, I realized that people would have their Christmases killed by two guys in uniform showing up to tell them their kin was dead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I became so agigated I had to change the channel</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116710956540095803/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116710956540095803&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116710956540095803'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116710956540095803'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/relaxing.html' title='Relaxing'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116710920191412783</id><published>2006-12-26T00:57:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-26T00:07:06.936-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Problem with Vista?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2006/12/25/business/25vista.xlarge1.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics10.nytimes.com/images/2006/12/25/business/25vista.xlarge1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Siggi Bucher/Reuters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;M&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;icrosoft has spent millions branding its new &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Vista operating system as the most secure product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; it has ever produced.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;hthttp://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/25/technology/25vista.htmltp://&quot;&gt;Flaws Are Detected in Microsoft’s Vista&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By JOHN MARKOFF&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 25, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 24 — Microsoft is facing an early crisis of confidence in the quality of its Windows Vista operating system as computer security researchers and hackers have begun to find potentially serious flaws in the system that was released to corporate customers late last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Dec. 15, a Russian programmer posted a description of a flaw that makes it possible to increase a user’s privileges on all of the company’s recent operating systems, including Vista. And over the weekend a Silicon Valley computer security firm said it had notified Microsoft that it had also found that flaw, as well as five other vulnerabilities, including one serious error in the software code underlying the company’s new Internet Explorer 7 browser.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The browser flaw is particularly troubling because it potentially means that Web users could become infected with malicious software simply by visiting a booby-trapped site. That would make it possible for an attacker to inject rogue software into the Vista-based computer, according to executives at Determina, a company based in Redwood City, Calif., that sells software intended to protect against operating system and other vulnerabilities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Determina is part of a small industry of companies that routinely pore over the technical details of software applications and operating systems looking for flaws. When flaws in Microsoft products are found they are reported to the software maker, which then produces fixes called patches. Microsoft has built technology into its recent operating systems that makes it possible for the company to fix its software automatically via the Internet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Despite Microsoft assertions about the improved reliability of Vista, many in the industry are taking a wait-and-see approach. Microsoft’s previous operating system, Windows XP, required two “service packs” issued over a number of years to substantially improve security, and new flaws are still routinely discovered by outside researchers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Friday, a Microsoft executive posted a comment on a company security information Web site stating the company was “closely monitoring” the vulnerability described by the Russian Web site. It permits the privileges of a standard user account in Vista and other versions of Windows to be increased, permitting control of all of the operations of the computer. In Unix and modern Windows systems, users are restricted in the functions they can perform, and complete power is restricted to certain administrative accounts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Currently we have not observed any public exploitation or attack activity regarding this issue,” wrote Mike Reavey, operations manager of the Microsoft Security Response Center. “While I know this is a vulnerability that impacts Windows Vista, I still have every confidence that Windows Vista is our most secure platform to date.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116710920191412783/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116710920191412783&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116710920191412783'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116710920191412783'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/problem-with-vista.html' title='Problem with Vista?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116710897334828864</id><published>2006-12-26T00:50:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-26T00:07:32.803-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Humilation</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061222/capt.wxs10612222244.koala_baby_wxs106.jpg?x=260&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=bZ1Q0cHxJL7Td8cqTBC9lA--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061222/capt.wxs10612222244.koala_baby_wxs106.jpg?x=260&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=bZ1Q0cHxJL7Td8cqTBC9lA--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Easier to get a nanny for her baby than a black child&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/26/us/26nannies.html?hp&amp;ex=1167109200&amp;amp;en=1449dff2486b1482&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage/&quot;&gt;Nanny Hunt Can Be a ‘Slap in the Face’ for Blacks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By JODI KANTOR&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 26, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Last month, Jennifer Freeman sat in a Chicago coffee bar, counting her blessings and considering her problem. She had a husband with an M.B.A. degree, two children and a job offer that would let her dig out the education degree she had stashed away during years of playdates and potty training.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But she could not accept the job. After weeks of searching, Ms. Freeman, who is African-American, still could not find a nanny for her son, 5, and daughter, 3. Agency after agency told her they had no one to send to her South Side home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As more blacks move up the economic ladder, one fixture — some would say necessity — of the upper-middle-class income bracket often eludes them. Like hailing a cab in Midtown Manhattan, searching for a nanny can be an exasperating, humiliating exercise for many blacks, the kind of ordeal that makes them wonder aloud what year it is.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“We’ve attained whatever level society says is successful, we’re included at work, but when we need the support for our children and we can afford it, why do we get treated this way?” asked Tanisha Jackson, an African-American mother of three in a Washington suburb, who searched on and off for five years before hiring a nanny. “It’s a slap in the face.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Numerous black parents successfully employ nannies, and many sitters say they pay no regard to race. But interviews with dozens of nannies and agencies that employ them in Atlanta, Chicago, New York and Houston turned up many nannies — often of African-American or Caribbean descent themselves — who avoid working for families of those backgrounds. Their reasons included accusations of low pay and extra work, fears that employers would look down at them, and suspicion that any neighborhood inhabited by blacks had to be unsafe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The result is that many black parents do not have the same child care options as their colleagues and neighbors. They must settle for illegal immigrants or non-English speakers instead of more experienced or credentialed nannies, rely on day care or scale back their professional aspirations to spend more time at home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“Very rarely will an African-American woman work for an African-American boss,” said Pat Cascio, the owner of Morningside Nannies in Houston and the president of the International Nanny Association.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many of the African-American nannies who make up 40 percent of her work force fear that people of their own color will be “uppity and demanding,” said Ms. Cascio, who is white. After interviews, she said, those nannies “will call us and say, ‘Why didn’t you tell me’ ” the family is black? &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lot of this, quite bluntly, comes from a slave mentality. It is easier for some blacks to serve whites than work for other blacks. Oddly, this isn&#39;t an issue in day care, where my mother wortked for 14 years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;West Indians often look down on American blacks and see them as losers. American blacks see West Indians as overtly servile to whites.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within African Americans, it&#39;s about class.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116710897334828864/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116710897334828864&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116710897334828864'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116710897334828864'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/humilation.html' title='Humilation'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116707785472690476</id><published>2006-12-25T15:09:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-25T23:44:38.613-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Stupid reporter</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061225/capt.xmb10812250529.australia_christmas_day_xmb108.jpg?x=380&amp;y=271&amp;amp;sig=.787VLgUmSJ5q1wDd3oDtw--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061225/capt.xmb10812250529.australia_christmas_day_xmb108.jpg?x=380&amp;y=271&amp;amp;sig=.787VLgUmSJ5q1wDd3oDtw--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt; (AP Photo/Mark Baker)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post reporters proving their intelligence&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Booman Tribune has this up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boomantribune.com/story/2006/12/24/105012/53/&quot;&gt; Lewinsky Gets Her Masters&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by BooMan&lt;br /&gt;Sun Dec 24th, 2006 at 10:50:12 AM EST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http:http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/23/AR2006122300875.html//&quot;&gt;Libby Copeland is the person that is dumb but smart.&lt;/a&gt; She is dumbfounded to learn that Monica Lewinsky has received a master&#39;s degree in Social Psychology from the London School of Economics. Lewinsky&#39;s thesis was &quot;In Search of the Impartial Juror: An Exploration of the Third Person Effect and Pre-Trial Publicity.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;blockquote&gt;There are moments that make you question your fundamental assumptions about the world. One of them took place a few days ago, when news emerged that Monica Lewinsky had just graduated from the London School of Economics.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  She did not!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Lewinsky, 33, is known more for her audacious coquetry than for her intellectual heft, and the notion of her earning a master of science degree in social psychology at the prestigious London university is jarring, akin to finding a rip in the time-space continuum, or discovering that Kim Jong Il is a natural blond.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What a crock of bullshit!! Did Ms. Copeland watch Lewinsky&#39;s deposition before the House Manager&#39;s torquemadic inquisition? Doesn&#39;t she remember how Ms. Lewinsky ran loops around the slow-witted Rep. Bryant? If anyone came away from l&#39;affair Lewinsky thinking Monica was dumb, then they are themselves dumb.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just one more example of how women are treated with a double standard. For Ms. Copeland it is simply unthinkable that a woman could be simultaneously smart and sexually attracted to the most powerful man in the world. I&#39;m beginning to wonder whether it is possible to be simultaneously smart and write for the Washington Post.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is bullshit. Lewinsky is a graduate of &lt;s&gt;Reed&lt;/s&gt; Lewis and Clark College, which is a well regarded school, and worked for the Pentagon. Lewinsky may have poor choice in men, but stupid , she isn&#39;t. This idea that she had to be a bimbo was prepretrated by the media.

He only supports the unity of the Shiites.&#39;&#39; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;;font-family:Geneva,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:85%;&quot;  &gt;The proposed coalition - which would not have included al-Sadr&#39;s supporters - could have isolated the militant cleric, commander of a militia army blamed for many sectarian attacks. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;;font-family:Geneva,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:85%;&quot;  &gt;Two U.S. soldiers were killed Saturday in separate roadside blasts near Baghdad, the U.S. military said. One bomb exploded southeast of the capital near a patrol searching for ``suspected terrorists,&#39;&#39; it said. That blast also wounded four other U.S. soldiers. The other bomb exploded southwest of Baghdad, near a patrol delivering supplies to units in the area. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;;font-family:Geneva,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:85%;&quot;  &gt;Police in Baghdad said they discovered 47 bodies - apparent victims of violence between Sunni and Shiites. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;;font-family:Geneva,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:85%;&quot;  &gt;Meanwhile, President Bush met with his new defense secretary Robert Gates at his presidential retreat in Camp David, Md., to discuss military options for Iraq including a proposal to send thousands more troops to the 140,000 already in Iraq to try to quell escalating violence, particularly in Baghdad. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;;font-family:Geneva,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:85%;&quot;  &gt;The president is expect to announce a revamped Iraq strategy in a speech to the nation between New Year&#39;s Day and Jan. 23, when he gives his State of the Union address. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;;font-family:Geneva,Arial,sans-serif;font-size:85%;&quot;  &gt;In Iraq, the focus was on politics. Several weeks ago, 30 Iraqi lawmakers and six Cabinet ministers who support al-Sadr launched a boycott of the government.

He was 73.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Brown was hospitalized with pneumonia at Emory Crawford Long Hospital on Sunday and died around 1:45 a.m. Monday, said his agent, Frank Copsidas of Intrigue Music.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Copsidas said the cause of death was uncertain. &#39;&#39;We really don&#39;t know at this point what he died of,&#39;&#39; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Along with Elvis Presley, Bob Dylan and a handful of others, Brown was one of the major musical influences of the past 50 years. At least one generation idolized him, and sometimes openly copied him. His rapid-footed dancing inspired Mick Jagger and Michael Jackson among others. Songs such as David Bowie&#39;s &#39;&#39;Fame,&#39;&#39; Prince&#39;s &#39;&#39;Kiss,&#39;&#39; George Clinton&#39;s &#39;&#39;Atomic Dog&#39;&#39; and Sly and the Family Stone&#39;s &#39;&#39;Sing a Simple Song&#39;&#39; were clearly based on Brown&#39;s rhythms and vocal style.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;&#39;He was an innovator, he was an emancipator, he was an originator. Rap music, all that stuff came from James Brown,&#39;&#39; entertainer Little Richard, a longtime friend of Brown&#39;s, told MSNBC. &#39;&#39;A great treasure is gone.&#39;&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If Brown&#39;s claim to the invention of soul can be challenged by fans of Ray Charles and Sam Cooke, then his rights to the genres of rap, disco and funk are beyond question. He was to rhythm and dance music what Dylan was to lyrics: the unchallenged popular innovator.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;&#39;James presented obviously the best grooves,&#39;&#39; rapper Chuck D of Public Enemy once told The Associated Press. &#39;&#39;To this day, there has been no one near as funky. No one&#39;s coming even close.&#39;&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His hit singles include such classics as &#39;&#39;Out of Sight,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;(Get Up I Feel Like Being a) Sex Machine,&#39;&#39; &#39;&#39;I Got You (I Feel Good)&#39;&#39; and &#39;&#39;Say It Loud -- I&#39;m Black and I&#39;m Proud,&#39;&#39; a landmark 1968 statement of racial pride.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116706756021506443/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116706756021506443&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116706756021506443'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116706756021506443'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/james-brown-1933-2006.html' title='James Brown 1933-2006'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116702626379637351</id><published>2006-12-25T00:57:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-25T00:57:43.810-05:00</updated><title type='text'></title><content type='html'>&lt;b&gt;WPIX Yule Log&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;object width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://youtube.com/v/J1YFU2Kv3Zw&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://youtube.com/v/J1YFU2Kv3Zw&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; width=&quot;425&quot; height=&quot;350&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;br&gt;Merry Christmas from The News Blog</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116702626379637351/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116702626379637351&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116702626379637351'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116702626379637351'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/wpix-yule-log-merry-christmas-from.html' title=''/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116702622565707811</id><published>2006-12-25T00:00:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-25T00:57:06.276-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The burdens of blogging</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.accd.edu/sac/lrc/librns/barbara/images/avequip/Mac-i-Book.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.accd.edu/sac/lrc/librns/barbara/images/avequip/Mac-i-Book.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We now live in an electronic world.

U.S. officials hope such a coalition would ease Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki&#39;s dependence on support from al-Sadr, whose followers, U.S. officials say, are responsible for much of the violence now convulsing Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But few Iraqi politicians have been willing to go along with the plan, which was riddled with problems from the onset, Iraqi officials said. U.S. backing for a new coalition has allowed al-Sadr to portray his opponents as American lackeys, they added.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;This idea was a non-starter,&quot; said Haider Abadi, a lawmaker and senior member of al-Maliki&#39;s Islamic Dawa Party. &quot;The U.S. administration is under pressure. They want to win public opinion by showing some form of progress, without knowing the situation on the ground. . . .

Just be sure to put &quot;Holiday Party Thread&quot; in the subject line so that I don&#39;t think it&#39;s another Nigerian currency scam email.

Ferguson, a black economist and education expert at Harvard, said that the global success of hip-hop had had positive influences on the self-esteem of black youths but that children who became obsessed with it “may unconsciously adopt the themes in this music as their lens for viewing the world.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the commercial success of gangsta rap and music videos, which portray men as extravagant thugs and women as sex toys, debate has simmered among black parents, community leaders and scholars about the impact of rap and the surrounding hip-hop culture.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“There’s a conversation going on now; a lot more people are trying to figure out a way to intervene that’s productive,” said Tricia Rose, a professor of Africana studies at Brown University.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At one extreme are critics, both black and white, who put primary blame for the failures and isolation of urban black youth on a self-destructive subculture, exemplified by the worst of hip-hop. But many of those critics, Dr. Rose said, fail to acknowledge the deeper roots of the problems. At the other extreme are people who reflexively defend any artistic expression by young blacks, saying the focus must remain on the economic and political structures that hem in minorities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“That’s the real catch,” Dr. Rose said. “The public conversation about hip-hop is pinned by two responses, neither of them productive.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you stoppedf treating Diddy and Jay-Z like heroes and demanded some accountabilty, this might not be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Someone needs to tell these kids this music is a fantasy, it isn&#39;t their lives, will never be their lives.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116698421580917391/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116698421580917391&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116698421580917391'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116698421580917391'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/limited-conversation.html' title='A limited conversation'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116689495932506259</id><published>2006-12-23T12:00:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-23T12:29:20.200-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Holiday time</title><content type='html'>I&#39;m travelling and Jen is busy, so this is the post of the day&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A few things:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Duke: I was astonished that the DA didn&#39;t firm up his rape case. Without ironclad proof, they should have never been charged with that. I disliked the Bill Bennett media campaign, but to find out today she was unsure? That was unfair to the defendents in a gross way. If three black athletes were facing rape charges similiar to this, first, they would be in jail, but the demand for a civil rights prosecution would explode.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, she was honest enough to admit she was unsure, which makes her a lot more than the scheming stripper people have embraced. But the reality was that it was going to be hard to convict. Because it is hard to get rape convictions, period. With a sex worker?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What annoyed me is the presumption that she was lying. She was intoxicated, she was among strangers of another race, she was obviously frightened. Any ID would be a guess. People who are asked to make cross-racial identifications are often wrong according to studies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And lets not forget that there was a recent California case where a woman was drugged, raped &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;on camera&lt;/span&gt; and they had to have a second trial. If the woman was out to get paid, this would have ended months ago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Rape cases are hard to prove under most circumstances. The pernicious idea that she was lying, instead of confused and wrong, should have been disproven yesterday. When asked, she didn&#39;t confirm her ID. Why? Maybe having her life turned inside out by Bob Bennett&#39;s DC thugs, with Duke cheering them on was too much. Maybe she just wasn&#39;t sure.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, hiding that there was other DNA on the woman&#39;s panty&#39;s was also wrong.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/12/22/15110/717&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/12/22/15110/717&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diaryTitle&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/12/22/15110/717&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;diaryTitle&quot;&gt;Worst People of 2006, Finalists: Washington City Paper and staff&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;h3 class=&quot;byline&quot;&gt;by &lt;a href=&quot;http://kos.dailykos.com/&quot;&gt;kos&lt;/a&gt;   &lt;/h3&gt;&lt;h4 class=&quot;date&quot;&gt;Fri Dec 22, 2006 at 12:21:52 PM PST&lt;/h4&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;intro&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lots of horrible people this year.

MOORE and ADAM NICHOLS&lt;br /&gt;DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The unarmed bridegroom killed in a 50-shot police barrage on his wedding day was driving drunk, sources said yesterday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean Bell had twice the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when officers opened fire, killing him and wounding two of his friends after they left his bachelor party at a Queens strip club, toxicology reports show.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The alcohol level is being used to back claims Bell&#39;s vehicle lurched into an officer and rammed an unmarked police van as cops started firing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;[This report] gives some insight into why Sean Bell acted the way he did behind the wheel,&quot; said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives&#39; Endowment Association. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;His behavior was reckless and life-threatening to the officer he hit. If the reports are true, his judgment was impaired.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is unclear if the reports, which a source in the medical examiner&#39;s office said were turned over to prosecutors, would have any bearing in a potential criminal case against the cops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a lawyer for Bell&#39;s family yesterday dismissed the findings as &quot;totally irrelevant.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;No matter what his blood-alcohol level was, he is a victim,&quot; said attorney Sanford Rubenstein.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Palladino is an idiot of tremendous proportions. The real question is how many of the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;cops&lt;/span&gt; were drunk. And that we will never know.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/482606p-406180c.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At Macy&#39;s, 24/7 is a slice of heaven&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BY VERONIKA BELENKAYA&lt;br /&gt;DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITER&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Of the countless New Yorkers who flooded the Macy&#39;s on Queens Blvd. in the wee hours yesterday, most took the saying &quot;Shop till you drop&quot; figuratively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there was Angelina Cedena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The 14-year-old was sprawled across the department store floor, her head tucked in, mounds of white plastic Macy&#39;s bags held close as though they were blankets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It&#39;s like a sleepover!&quot; gushed the Middle Village teen, admitting that fatigue had gotten the best of her.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We&#39;ll be back tomorrow night,&quot; she added. &quot;There&#39;s less people.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t count on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sleep-deprived shoppers easily numbered in the thousands, taking advantage of the shopping marathon that began at 7 a.m. Thursday and won&#39;t end until 6 p.m. tomorrow, Christmas Eve - 83 hours of retail madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I have no time. I didn&#39;t think I was going to be able to shop at all,&quot; said Angelina&#39;s mother, April Cedena, 31, showing off four Vera Wang perfume box sets. &quot;This is a godsend!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Retail experts believe that the 24-hour, open-door policy - a staple of places like Wal-Mart - was a first in New York. And aside from a small glitch that briefly hampered credit card sales at about 3 a.m., everything went smoothly, as though it were a normal shopping day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Twenty-four hours! Isn&#39;t that something!&quot; said Takiya Hanley, 30, an MTA station clerk from Crown Heights who was examining a pair of DKNY Jeans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We were at the Macy&#39;s on Flatbush. It closed at 11, so we came here. In a big city like New York, more stuff should be open 2-4/7.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116689495932506259/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116689495932506259&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116689495932506259'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116689495932506259'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/holiday-time.html' title='Holiday time'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116680256504572821</id><published>2006-12-22T06:17:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-22T10:49:26.020-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Atlantic Yards......a bad idea</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/893660/atyards.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/400/907065/atyards.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/482424p-405810c.html&quot;&gt;A groundbreaking coalition&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When it comes to adding jobs &amp; housing,&lt;br /&gt;majority rules with a winning plan&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The most interesting and least-reported story behind the final state approval of the $4 billion Atlantic Yards project this week is the emergence in Brooklyn of a pro-development coalition of private-sector builders and black working-class residents who are leading a tenacious fight to bring jobs and housing to the borough.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Standing in the path of progress are middle-class civic groups whose mostly white leaders profess concern for low-income New Yorkers - and even claim to speak for them - but shed the illusion of liberal compassion the minute the poor folk get uppity and start negotiating their own deals for the future of their families and communities.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recognizing this dynamic is the only way to understand several high-profile development battles going on in Brooklyn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The recent opening of a Fairway supermarket in Red Hook and the scheduled opening of an Ikea superstore were both made possible because of a link between low-income public housing residents and developers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After years of playing a relatively passive role in neighborhood affairs, public housing leaders broke with local civic groups and began negotiating directly for jobs and other benefits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This led to friction between leaders from the Red Hook Houses, the public housing development whose residents make up about 70% of the neighborhood&#39;s population, and the Red Hook Civic Association, which fought tooth and nail against the creation of a Fairway in Red Hook and resumed the fight with a lawsuit when Ikea came knocking.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A similar dynamic is at work in the case of Atlantic Yards, which will consist of an 18,000-seat arena, retail space, a hotel and 16 glass towers with office space and 6,430 housing units.&lt;br /&gt;...........................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This year, when I asked the project&#39;s sponsor, Forest City, for the names of the community groups backing the project, I was sent a list of more than 200 block associations and other organizations. These are mostly the kinds of groups that don&#39;t have the money to create fancy Web sites, daily blogs or press conferences to push their views, but their support for the project has been rock-solid.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every reasonably objective indicator of neighborhood sentiment demonstrated local approval. Opinion polls sponsored by the New York Observer and Crain&#39;s showed local residents favoring the project, and candidates for local offices who ran on a platform of halting or slowing the project this year went down in flames at the polls.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And the race baiting in this article is fundamentally dishonest. Forest City Ratner basically told working class black people that they would get jobs and shiny new homes. Which is probably not going to happen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Atlantic Yards is overscale, ugly and will destroy the character of the neighborhood. But more importantly, those jobs will not materialize, because they never do. Unless there are firm committments, nothing happens.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;white&quot; people opposing this could have been rich in supporting this plan. They could have been bought off. &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;They&lt;/span&gt; own homes. Why doesn&#39;t Louis mention that Charles Barron, who is as black as you can get, opposes this plan, as does Yvette Clark.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Ratner did was buy support. What they did not do, is project what will happen in the years ahead.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You see the scale of those red buildings?  Notice everything around them. How long you think that lasts? The people who approve this project today will be driven out by rising prices and gentrification. The surrounding blocks will see their value climb, but for small business owners, the character of the neighborhood will shift. They&#39;re being told that they will benefit. Please. Compare Hoboken 1985 to 2006. If you didn&#39;t own a home, you live somewhere else.  The character of the businesses will change. As will the color of the owners.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for jobs: construction? How binding are any training and apprentice agreements? If they aren&#39;t enacted. what happens?  My guess, nothing.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lets understand something. Most of the people Ratner bougtht off want jobs and have ZERO power to enforce any deal. The people who are opposing this have a very good idea of what comes next. They aren&#39;t seeing the follow on of having those large, ungainly buildings in their midst. Which is a very different, very white neighborhood, the new Hoboken.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why? Because prices will rise, it&#39;s close to the city, and the sea of young white professionals which changed Hoboken will fill those buildings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why did the locals want a Fairway and Ikea? Besides the jobs, &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;they don&#39;t drive.&lt;/span&gt; They need the jobs and don&#39;t care about the traffic. The new homeowners know what a parking lot jam is like.&lt;br /&gt;The residents of Red Hook houses will learn the hard way.&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, about the stadium: what an insane idea.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one in New York cares about the Nets. Their fan base is in Jersey. Their fans will drive in.&lt;br /&gt;Atlantic Avenue with massive traffic jams three nights a week. Drunk Nets fans roaming the streets, filling bars. Remember, unlike Knick fans, Nets fans drive. They aren&#39;t going to stop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A limited use building, for a team most Brooklynites will root against, filling the streets with traffic.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Jets made the same promise, but the insanity of their plan was obvious. Here, Ratner went to people without the resources to check his promises and offered them money and support. The people who had the resources opposed the plan or it&#39;s scale.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why do you need this monstrosity in downtown Brooklyn? Who does it serve? The five Nets fans in Brooklyn? Or rich developers, gullible &quot;community activists&quot; and even more gullible newspaper columnists.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116680256504572821/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116680256504572821&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116680256504572821'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116680256504572821'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/atlantic-yardsa-bad-idea.html' title='Atlantic Yards......a bad idea'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116678586125192593</id><published>2006-12-22T06:07:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-22T06:11:01.310-05:00</updated><title type='text'>I love New York</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/ips_rich_content/473-my_deli.JPG&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 200px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/ips_rich_content/473-my_deli.JPG&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/482410p-405865c.html&quot;&gt; Mob rap in bagel boom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Feds tie S.I. attack in &#39;01 to gangland rivals&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BY ERNIE NASPRETTO and JOHN MARZULLI&lt;br /&gt;DAILY NEWS STAFF WRITERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Only in New York would a Mafia associate nicknamed The Irishman allegedly provide a bomb used to destroy a Pakistani immigrant&#39;s deli that was competing with a bagel store protected by the mob.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Cowards threw a firebomb into an occupied grocery store and then ran away,&quot; said William McMahon of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Deli owner Hamim Syed was warned by an acquaintance that his plan to open a second convenience store would not sit well with &quot;two strong Italian partners&quot; with ties to a nearby bagel store.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In what may have been a staged extortion scheme, Syed was paid a visit by &quot;Sonny&quot; and &quot;Vinny&quot; - later identified as Luchese crime members - who warned him &quot;things could get ugly,&quot; according to court papers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The plot thickened when Syed sought help from a Pakistani businessman with ties to the Genovese crime family who arranged a sitdown with two other gangsters at the Hooters restaurant in Staten Island in the summer of 2001.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Syed thought the matter was resolved and went ahead with his expansion plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;...........&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fisher, a retired city Sanitation worker known as The Irishman, was allegedly tasked to give a bomb to another Gambino associate, Salvatore Palmieri.

Al Sharpton for making the shooting a &quot;racial incident.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;When the dust settles and the smoke clears, reasonableness will prevail in that grand jury,&quot; Palladino said on Brian Lehrer&#39;s show on WNYC 93.9 FM, &quot;and we&#39;ll be able to articulate that the shooting, although tragic, was not criminal and was justified.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palladino praised the investigation led by Queens District Attorney Richard Brown into the Nov. 25 event, when officers unleashed 50 shots on Bell and his friends outside a Queens strip club.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palladino&#39;s prediction angered Sharpton, who called it evidence of a too-cozy&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palladino and Sharpton - who verbally sparred after last week&#39;s protest march down Fifth Ave. - traded barbs again yesterday, as the union chief accused the civil rights activist of trying to tamper with the potential pool of grand jurors by making the shooting about race.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Race has nothing to do with it,&quot; Palladino said. &quot;In fact, three of the five people who discharged their weapons are people of color ... [but] now if you&#39;re a cop, you&#39;re a racist.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharpton shook off the accusation and claimed that &quot;if all of those officers were black, I&#39;d still be there demanding justice.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter about the race here,&quot; he said. &quot;It matters about the deed.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If they don&#39;t indict the cops, don&#39;t expect to go anywhere in New York City in January. This isn&#39;t 1999. People will not just turn their back and let this happen. You cannot shoot at three men 50 times and walk away.  Giuliani is no longer mayor. Bloomberg was elected with black votes, twice.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This city will turn into strike-bound Paris if those cops, who have not testified to anyone, are not charged with murder in the second degree. Nothing less is going to fly.  People believe Sean Bell was murdered by the NYPD. Saying it&#39;s an accident will not fly without a ton of evidence. And even then, the demand for a Special Prosecutor and FBI probe will bring city politics to a halt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palladino is a fucking idiot. He dragged Steven Pagones down here, a man who many people think was paid for raping Tawana Brawley. And now he complains about race?  But the unions think it&#39;s about Sharpton. It isn&#39;t. The family wants a special prosecutor, and if Brown doesn&#39;t indict, Spitzer is going to HAVE to appoint one, leaving a large turd on Bloomberg and Kelly&#39;s desk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The media said a few hundred people protested on Wall Street. It&#39;s the Thursday before Christmas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You want a repeat in January, with no indictment, it won&#39;t be 300 people.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What Palladino misses is people see it as racial because the &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;victim&lt;/span&gt; was black. It doesn&#39;t matter what the cops were.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But what he doesn&#39;t get is that is way past Sharpton. Bill Thompson, likely to be the next mayor of New York, the heads of the major unions, all marched Saturday. While they&#39;re letting the radicals do their daily protests, make no mistake, Sharpton is only one player here. I would look closely at Roger Toussaint and Calvin Butts. They are recently energized from various issues, and bring a great deal of weight to any protests. The UFT and SEIU are also major players here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Attacking Sharpton is a mistake. He&#39;s not leading the band here. Because he doesn&#39;t have to.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sean Bell was a middle class black New Yorker. He had a family, a job and one hell of a fiance. He is what people want their kids to be.  If there were bumps, he was moving towards a responsible life.  Not that they proved any.  His parents don&#39;t speak with accents, there is no exile community politics, and black and Latino New York is united behind them like nothing I&#39;ve ever seen.  There is a depth of resolve which simply didn&#39;t exist under Giuliani, partly because there were too few people willing to stand up to him and the media was on his side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Transit strike changed that. The Daily News realized that their readers were, uh, minorities and their coverage changed the day after they saw polling backing the workers. The White ethnic rule of New York was over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, make no mistake, no indictment, a wave of protests we have not seen in years. Not riots, but well planned, well orgainzed, city grinding protests, which will force Ray Kelly from his job as the first step.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A line has been crossed in the city&#39;s history.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116677248353051998/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116677248353051998&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116677248353051998'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116677248353051998'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/times-have-changed.html' title='Times have changed'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116676775460496531</id><published>2006-12-22T01:02:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-22T01:45:46.596-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Uh, these are Public Schools</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/569549/blmger.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/726271/blmger.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/22/nyregion/22cerf.html&quot;&gt;School Entrepreneur Named to Be a Deputy Chancellor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 22, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein yesterday appointed the former president of Edison Schools Inc., the world’s largest for-profit operator of public schools, as a deputy chancellor, perhaps the boldest move yet in the Bloomberg administration’s effort to increase the role of the private sector in managing city public schools.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The former Edison president, Chris Cerf, is a longtime friend of Mr. Klein and has been a consultant to the city’s Education Department since early this year, paid with private donations. He is part of a team that has been re-evaluating virtually every aspect of the overhaul of the school system in Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s first term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The consulting deal ends Dec. 31, after which Mr. Cerf will be deputy chancellor for operational strategy, human capital and external affairs — a $196,571-a-year post that will formalize his role in Mr. Klein’s inner circle and make him the system’s top official for labor relations and negotiations, principal and teacher recruitment and training, media relations and political affairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chancellor, who is 60, and his new deputy, who is 52, have much in common. Both clerked at the United States Supreme Court — Mr. Cerf for Justice Sandra Day O’Connor — and both worked as lawyers in the Clinton White House. Both spent time in private law practice in Washington. They even share the astrological sign Scorpio.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But it is their shared view that the private sector should play a major role in public education that may be most significant to their work in the nation’s largest school system. Mr. Cerf has been deeply involved in the “empowerment initiative,” the recent effort to free principals from the oversight of superintendents provided that they sign an agreement to meet performance targets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Some officials believe the logical next step in that process would be to hire private groups to manage networks of schools run by such principals. The private groups, which officials said might be nonprofit groups or for-profit companies like Edison, would oversee schools, would be responsible for results and could be fired if test scores lagged.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shouldn&#39;t there be SOME public input into this plan. Edison was rejected once already.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116676775460496531/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116676775460496531&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116676775460496531'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116676775460496531'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/uh-these-are-public-schools.html' title='Uh, these are Public Schools'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116675655945900227</id><published>2006-12-22T01:00:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-21T22:02:39.473-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Do these people ever leave their caves?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/425284/sadr.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/139991/sadr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Thank you, infidel Congressman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;This shall motivate my men&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bluenc.com/robin-hayes-says-we-will-win-in-iraq-by-spreading-the-message-of-jesus-christ-there&quot;&gt;Robin Hayes says we will win in Iraq by &quot;spreading the message of Jesus Christ&quot; there.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Submitted by LiberalNC on Wed, 12/20/2006 - 8:27pm.&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Robin Hayes has the solution to the Iraq war: have our soldiers convert all Muslims to Christianity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Having won the election by only a hair’s width and almost getting himself kicked out of Congress seems to have had some profound psychological effects on poor Mr. Hayes.

Data for 2006 is not yet available.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2005, the number of soldiers in the Iraq theater who killed themselves was 22, double the 2004 figure of 11, but below the 2003 figure of 25, Morales said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Armywide, the number of reported suicides was 88 in 2005, up from 67 in 2004 and 78 in 2003, said Walter E. Morales, Army suicide prevention manager.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the 2005 downrange suicides, five had been deployed more than once, said Dr. (Col.) Edward Crandell, who was in charge of the survey team to Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Crandell said suicide rates can vary up to 40 percent in a given year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Asked about the increase in suicides in Iraq and Kuwait between 2004 and 2005, Crandell replied, “There’s no way to predict suicides.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Army’s Surgeon General, Dr. (Lt. Gen.) Kevin Kiley, said he does not see a trend in the suicide rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It only takes a few to shift the numbers,” Kiley said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116675629714176966/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116675629714176966&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116675629714176966'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116675629714176966'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/sucide-is-not-painless.html' title='Sucide is not painless'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116676691543655971</id><published>2006-12-22T00:45:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-22T02:29:42.926-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Marines face death penalty in Haditha killing</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061220/2006_12_20t035715_450x348_us_haditha_marine.jpg?x=380&amp;y=293&amp;amp;sig=ffpBMNYFqRLcVGzoSV3i2A--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061220/2006_12_20t035715_450x348_us_haditha_marine.jpg?x=380&amp;y=293&amp;amp;sig=ffpBMNYFqRLcVGzoSV3i2A--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Haditha&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/22/world/middleeast/22haditha.html?hp&amp;ex=1166850000&amp;amp;amp;en=eef96788002f07ff&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt;Marines Charge 4 With Murder of Iraq Civilians&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By PAUL von ZIELBAUER and CAROLYN MARSHALL&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 22, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Four marines were charged yesterday with murder in the killings of two dozen Iraqi civilians, including at least 10 women and children, in the village of Haditha last year, military officials said at Camp Pendleton, Calif.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Military prosecutors also charged four officers, including a lieutenant colonel in charge of the First Marine Regiment’s Third Battalion, with dereliction of duty and failure to ensure that accurate information about the killings was delivered up the Marine Corps’ chain of command. A military investigation has found evidence that Marine officers may have obscured certain facts in the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Marines could punish other ranking officers administratively in weeks to come. But the criminal charges filed yesterday against Lt. Col. Jeffrey R. Chessani, 42, and three other officers reflect an unusually aggressive judicial reaction by military prosecutors to a massacre that has damaged the military’s credibility with Iraqi officials and civilians, military justice experts said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is very aggressive charging — wow,” said Gary Solis, who teaches the law of war at Georgetown University Law Center and at West Point. “I think this illustrates the deep seriousness the Marine Corps takes with these events.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He added, “I definitely think the Marine Corps is sending a message to commanders, to those in authority of combat troops, that they better pay close attention to the activities of their subordinates to ensure that there was no wrongdoing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though this was not the first instance of American forces being charged with killing Iraqi civilians, the charges announced yesterday, including 13 counts of murder against one sergeant alone, Staff Sgt. Frank Wuterich, 26, suggest that military prosecutors view the Haditha killings as being among the most serious breaches of military rules in the nearly four-year war. The charges are a result of two military investigations into the actions of members of Company K, Third Battalion, First Marine Regiment after a roadside bomb killed one of their comrades shortly after 7 a.m. on Nov. 19, 2005, in Haditha, a village in a region northwest of Baghdad that is rife with Sunni Arab insurgents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A total of 24 Iraqis, nearly all of them unarmed, were killed by several marines in a series of attacks on a car and three nearby homes over the next several hours, military officials said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four enlisted men charged with unpremeditated murder, all members of a squad of Company K, Third Battalion, First Marine Regiment, are: Sergeant Wuterich of Meriden, Conn.; Sgt. Sanick De La Cruz, 24, of Chicago; Lance Cpl. Justin L. Sharratt, 22, of Carbondale, Pa.; and Lance Cpl. Stephen B. Tatum, 25, of Edmund, Okla.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the Iraq War Slovik case. They have six murder trials for soldiers serving in Iraq. The government is going to try and kill all of the defendents charged with murder.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In January, 1945, Private Eddie Slovik was executed for desertion under fire. There had been 10000 cases, but they had to do something, and Slovak was that something.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116676691543655971/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116676691543655971&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116676691543655971'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116676691543655971'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/marines-face-death-penalty-in-haditha.html' title='Marines face death penalty in Haditha killing'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116676604031761210</id><published>2006-12-22T00:28:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-22T00:40:40.493-05:00</updated><title type='text'>A bottle full of stupid</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/695358/sharpton.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/680906/sharpton.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;They tried to demonize him, he&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;ran for president.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;JONAH GOLDBERG&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-goldberg21dec21,0,4491039.column?coll=la-opinion-rightrail&quot;&gt;Giuliani: the man to defend American culture&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To win the GOP nomination, socially liberal Giuliani must burnish to conservatives the tough-guy credentials he earned as New York mayor.&lt;br /&gt;Jonah Goldberg&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;December 21, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;AMERICA NEEDS a Pym Fortuyn, and Rudolph Giuliani may be the man for the job.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pim Fortuyn, you may recall, was the gay, flamboyant sociology professor turned &quot;right-wing&quot; Dutch politician who took a hard-line position against immigration and Islamic extremism — two issues inextricably linked in a country where whole communities have become enclaves of Sharia law. Fortuyn was labeled as right wing by identity-politics leftists for his unapologetic view that the Netherlands should stay both liberal and libertine.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His basic view was that the Netherlands has a culture too, and there&#39;s no shame in defending civil liberties, free expression and tolerance against their opponents, even if those opponents exploit liberal guilt by casting themselves as victims. In other words, Fortuyn wanted to keep the party going, and that meant taking a strong line against the killjoys. That Fortuyn could be both libertarian and tough-minded caused great cognitive dissonance in the media and on the left — there and here. He was assassinated by a left-wing extremist.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giuliani needs to tell a story of how he beat Al Sharpton at every turn. Giuliani&#39;s cheery immigrant story and his personal liberalism make him a particularly formidable spokesman for such a vision. Yes, taken piecemeal, his views on social issues could be a real albatross in GOP primaries (though it&#39;s worth noting that Giuliani, while personally pro-choice, signals that he would appoint judges in the mold of Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas). But if Giuliani can make those sorts of issues seem secondary to a broader defense of American civilization, he&#39;s got a chance to go all the way. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If America needs a vile, divisive bigot, Giuliani is your man.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Goldberg is on crack if he thinks Sharpton lost ground to Giuliani. In 1993, Sharpton was known, but he certainly couldn&#39;t command the power of the city&#39;s black politicians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By 1999, he was the most powerful black politican in New York. You simply could not mobilize people without his support. But once you did, you could shut the city down. It was Sharpton&#39;s direct action which forced Giuliani to meet with black politicians.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sharpton played Giuliani and forced his hand more than once. He never called him a racist, and made sure to be around who ever challenged him, from cab drivers to gays. &lt;br /&gt;Goldberg lives in DC, right?

The story, he said, stemmed from testimony given by a witness during Ms. Regan’s divorce from Robert Kleinschmidt but she had had nothing to do with the incident.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Fields said Ms. Regan had not been investigated or reprimanded over an anti-Semitic remark at work.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The furor over Ms. Regan began last month after the News Corporation, the parent company of HarperCollins Publishers, canceled a planned book and television special featuring O. J. Simpson discussing how he hypothetically might have killed his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ronald L. Goldman.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last week, Ms. Regan was abruptly fired after a heated telephone conversation with Mark Jackson, a lawyer for HarperCollins, in which she reportedly made anti-Semitic remarks.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Monday, Mr. Fields promised to sue HarperCollins for breach of contract. “She would never issue any anti-Semitic remark, and she didn’t,” Mr. Fields said at the time. “It’s an outrageous lie to cover the fact that they have no possible basis for terminating Judith.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116675402629078387/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116675402629078387&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116675402629078387'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116675402629078387'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/wow-talk-about-jew-hatred.html' title='Wow.

Warm Bodies and Duty Descriptions &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;One of IAVA&#39;s most thoughtful members is Ray Kimball, who served in Iraq as an aviation officer for the Army. I offer to you a fantastic piece by Ray discussing all the recent hollow talk of troop numbers and increasing the size of the military. I am sure you find it interesting.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that the President has officially gotten behind the idea that we need a larger Army and Marine Corps (and better late than never, I say), it&#39;s worth casting some thought to just who and what those extra warm bodies should be.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nothing sets my teeth on edge more than reading some egghead&#39;s report calling for some half-assed troop increase with a nice, round number, and no further detail on exactly what that increase should look like. This only confirms one of Rumsfeld&#39;s worst bon mots, &quot;people are fungible.&quot; And please don&#39;t give me the old chestnut of &quot;we&#39;ll let our generals figure out when and where they need the troops&quot; - that&#39;s not the way our system works, and hasn&#39;t for a long time. The last military officer who had that much autonomy in translating raw numbers into force capabilities was George Marshall, whose like is nowhere to be found today. Any troop increase authorized by Congress is going to have to be specific and detailed - below is my shot at it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ll put a warning up front - anyone looking for a huge increase in combat arms capability (infantry, armor, artillery) is going to be sorely disappointed. The fact of the matter is, our current capability in warfighting overmatches anyone else on the planet by a significant margin, and is likely to stay that way. It&#39;s not the strain of war that is breaking our military - it&#39;s the strain of winning the peace, and while our square peg combat arms can be forced into that round hole, the forces below are far better equipped for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My Troop Wish List:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;1. An Africa Command (AFRICOM)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We have Unified Commands all over the world, who are responsible for the employment and operations of US forces in that part of the globe. These commands are uniquely tailored to the specific demands of their part of the world - except for Africa, which is currently an added responsibility to the European Command. This makes about as much sense as having the elected US Representatives from Massachusetts pull double duty as voting for the residents of Texas. The staffing should be comparable to PACOM&#39;s current setup, with a single staff supplemented by additional support elements. Troops required: 2100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;2. MP Brigades&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Every overseas Unified Command (including the Africa Command, above) needs an Military Police (MP) brigade over and above what they&#39;ve got right now. In our current structure, these are the units best suited for the three-block war currently underway in so many parts of the world. Once of many advantages of this unit is that it&#39;s designed with decentralized operations in mind, a must for future ops. Yes, I&#39;d love to design the perfect unit, with just the right mix of linguists, vehicles, etc., but the current requirements for building a TO&amp;E are so cumbersome that you&#39;d finally get your units in, oh say, 2030. Exact numbers for this type of unit are not readily available on public domain websites, but 5500 troops seems to be a common estimate. Four of these brigades (one each for PACOM, SOUTHCOM, AFRICOM, and CENTCOM) would therefore need a total of 22,000 soldiers. Yes, I left out EUCOM, largely because any surge of forces needed for that part of the world should come largely from our brethren in NATO, seeing as how it&#39;s their backyard.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;3. Engineer Brigades&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Our current rhetoric talks a lot about &quot;clear, hold and build&quot; - the problem is that, while our trigger-pullers are exceptional at clearing, holding and building are two other things entirely. The MP brigades, above, are intended to be the holders - the engineer brigades are the builders. Or, more specifically, the folks who can partner with host nation capabilities to help them build the infrastructure and capabilities they need for representative institutions to flourish and take root. Again, the strength of this organization is its capability for decentralized operations. Public numbers seem to be somewhere in the vicinity of 9500 soldiers. Again, four brigades translates into a total of 38,000 soldiers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;4. Support Elements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;None of the above are self-sustaining or a unit unto their own. Each has specialized equipment and vehicles with unique support and maintenance requirements. Pinning down the exact numbers is problematic - as a rough thumbnail, I&#39;d call it 12,000 soldiers, or roughly 20% above the manning of the units above. These would not be new units, but additions or supplements to units already in place to support those Unified Commands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;5. Permanent MiTT Teams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, I&#39;d give every Unified Command a permanent MiTT structure, similar to what&#39;s operating in Iraq now. Think of this as preventive medicine - these folks could be crucial in training local militaries and police, and helping to prevent problems before they start. Each structure has about 4200 soldiers, so this translates into 16,800 troops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the grand total is 90,900 additional troops---if we&#39;re really serious about this Long War. At current costs for salary and benefits, that translates to an additional $9 Billion per year in personnel costs, to say nothing of the costs of purchasing and maintaining their equipment.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you disagree with the numbers or the picked units, well, that&#39;s to be expected. My larger point is this - anyone (and that includes the President, Senators, Representatives, DoD types and folks in uniform) who just sling around numbers with no thought as to what they represent or how they&#39;re going to implemented should be treated like the mindless dilettantes they are. When talking about troops, numbers just aren&#39;t enough.&lt;/blockquote&gt;I would argue that the Army needs to decide who they train for jobs long before they do anything else. It has long been an advantage to promote supply service jobs to gain enlistees, when most of these troops are virtually combat ineffective.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need less artillery and air defense, more infantry and civil affairs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we also need are more rapid reaction units. Maybe adding on another airborne Brigade to the four we have now, units based on the French 6th light division, able to move with armored cars quickly. Iraq is the anomoly to our future wars. We will face more civil disorder than anything else.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also need to look hard at the Marines as well. They have a completely different tactical philosophy and are restrained by naval requirements.  What are their roles? What do they do? It isn&#39;t just adding more bodies, it&#39;s using them effectively&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as the expansion of specials forces, we need to decide what they&#39;re going to do as well. Is it direct action, or reconnaisance, or counter-terrorism. One of the things the Army should consider is reestablishing long range reconnaissance as a special operation force and not splitting the job between the Rangers and Special Forces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need to think about a real 21st military, not just patching together the one we have</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116671500634094434/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116671500634094434&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116671500634094434'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116671500634094434'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/new-army.html' title='The new Army'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116670391141992667</id><published>2006-12-21T07:19:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-21T07:25:11.480-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The gay club</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/428730/menkisisng.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/426287/menkisisng.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-pastors21dec21,0,5688143.story?track=tottext&quot;&gt;Christian leaders seek to help pastors battle desires&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gay-sex controversies have led not to new theology but to a call for the church to help pastors fight their urges.&lt;br /&gt;By Stephanie Simon, Times Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;December 21, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;DENVER — Recent gay-sex scandals involving evangelical pastors have prompted much soul-searching among conservative Christian leaders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No one has proposed rethinking the theology that homosexuality is a sin. Instead, there&#39;s a growing consensus that the church must do a better job of helping pastors resist all immoral desires, such as a lust for pornography, an addiction to drugs or a lifelong same-sex attraction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Seminary professors, Christian counselors and veteran clergy say the best way to help pastors fight temptation is to get them talking — even about their most shameful secrets. They don&#39;t want a sordid tell-all from the pulpit each Sunday. But they would like pastors to bare their weaknesses and admit their lapses before a small group of &quot;accountability partners&quot; — friends committed to listen with empathy, then rebuke or advise as needed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Our current environment demands perfection of pastors,&quot; said Craig Williford, president of the Denver Seminary. &quot;It doesn&#39;t allow leaders to struggle, to be human, to deal with their issues without fear of losing their ministry. We need to help them find safe harbors.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Williford recently attended a conference with 50 seminary presidents; most, he said, had pushed this issue to the top of their agenda after the scandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most recent involved the Rev. Paul Barnes, 54, who resigned Dec. 10 as pastor of a large church in suburban Denver after confessing to repeated trysts with men. In a tearful goodbye video, Barnes told his congregation he had struggled with homosexuality since he was a boy. &quot;I can&#39;t tell you the number of nights I have cried myself to sleep, begging God to take this away,&quot; Barnes said, according to the Denver Post. One of its reporters viewed the video before the church sealed it last week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The confession in many ways echoed a farewell letter the Rev. Ted Haggard, 50, wrote his Colorado Springs mega-church last month after admitting to contact with a male prostitute.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Both men described their lives as a decades-long battle against their desires. They said they had tried numerous strategies to overcome their feelings but did not succeed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some gay-rights activists had hoped these accounts would prompt a reevaluation of the widespread view among evangelicals that homosexuality is a choice — and that it can be overcome with prayer and discipline. &quot;If one of these guys in power would say &#39;I&#39;ve been wrong,&#39; that would change the world,&quot; said the Rev. Mel White, who runs a faith-based gay-rights group called Soulforce.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But many evangelicals have drawn a very different lesson from the scandals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They note that Barnes and Haggard said they felt alone in their struggles, unable to confide in anyone. And they blame that isolation — at least in part — for the pastors&#39; falls.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We don&#39;t know how to deal with what&#39;s going on inside us, so we stuff it, or deny it, or adamantly preach against it,&quot; said the Rev. Kurt Fredrickson, who directs the doctorate program at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rev. H.B. London, who runs a clergy counseling program for the Focus on the Family ministry in Colorado Springs, said: &quot;There&#39;s a loneliness, even though you&#39;re surrounded by lots of people, and that often drives you to try to fill your life in another way.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Oh, faith partner, is it wrong to imagine Heath Ledger pounding my ass in a tent?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Why yes it is, just as it is wrong to imagine blowing Lance Bass backstage&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Let&#39;s pray as we listen to Donnie McClurkin&quot;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116670391141992667/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116670391141992667&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116670391141992667'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116670391141992667'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/gay-club.html' title='The gay club'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116668142404926971</id><published>2006-12-21T01:03:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-21T01:11:35.200-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Who rules the streets?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/500104/mahdi%20army.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/596899/mahdi%20army.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/20/AR2006122002047_pf.html&quot;&gt;Shiite Clerics&#39; Rivalry Deepens In Fragile Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Sudarsan Raghavan&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Foreign Service&lt;br /&gt;Thursday, December 21, 2006; A01&lt;br /&gt;....................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;They question whether Hakim can counter Sadr&#39;s growing street power without worsening the chaos. As President Bush ponders limited alternatives in forging a new approach in Iraq, some wonder whether the United States is overestimating Hakim&#39;s ability.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The U.S. embrace of Hakim &quot;will deepen their rivalry,&quot; said Mahmoud Othman, an independent Kurdish legislator. &quot;And it will deepen the rifts between the United States and the Sadrists.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.......................................&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Pouring Their Poison In&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Inside the Sayyed Idris mosque, a large shrine in Karrada with an ornate blue-and-yellow tiled minaret, Haji Abbas al-Zubaidi is a witness to this changing world.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For years, the picture of Hakim&#39;s white-bearded brother, Ayatollah Mohammed Bakir Hakim, who was killed by a car bomb in 2003, hung in the mosque&#39;s library along with images of Sistani and a collection of revered Shiite saints. Now, pictures of Sadr and his father hang along with them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baghdad&#39;s sectarian strife now rules Zubaidi&#39;s life. In recent weeks, car bombs and mass kidnappings have rocked his neighborhood.&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; Zubaidi, who has lived in Karrada for 35 years, sees the Mahdi Army, not the Badr Organization, as his main source of protection. It has created &quot;popular protection committees&quot; that watch over blocks, as they do in the Mahdi Army&#39;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; stronghold of Sadr City.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The terrorists are pouring their poison into our neighborhood,&quot; said Zubaidi, slim with long, slender fingers and a narrow face, as he sat on a large red carpet inside the mosque. &quot;The sons of Karrada who have joined the popular committees and the Mahdi Army are now 98 percent in control. We have noticed that many of the attempts have been foiled.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Zubaidi and other educated Karrada residents continue to obey Sistani&#39;s pacifist vision and view him as their preeminent leader. &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;But younger Shiites, while still revering Sistani, have switched their allegiances.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We imitate and follow Sayyed Sistani,&quot; said Zubaidi, using an honorific for Sistani. &quot;As for the field commanders and the young men, they are followers of Moqtada Sadr.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.....................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In many circles, Iraqis question whether Hakim and other so-called moderates can curb the growing power of Sadr.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;I have serious doubts about Mr. Hakim&#39;s influence among the Shiites, and I have serious doubts of Hashemi becoming the leader of Sunnis,&quot; Nadhmi said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s a sentiment shared in Karrada. &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Al-Hakim is not loved by the people,&quot; said Abdul Amir Ali, a burly Shiite shopkeeper. &quot;People love the Islamic Dawa Party and Maliki because they don&#39;t have militias.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the sidewalk restaurant where Sadr&#39;s poster hangs, its owner, Ali Hussein, points at clusters of young men nearby. They are all Mahdi Army, he said. And so is he.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hakim, he said, made a fatal mistake by meeting Bush. In today&#39;s Iraq, credibility and power are measured by opposition to the United States.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;At this time, whoever has his hands with the Americans or Jews is not an Iraqi,&quot; said Hussein, as he chopped up cubes of lamb.&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt; &quot;So how could Hakim put his hands with the Americans? There will be tensions because Sayyed Moqtada Sadr is a revolutionary man, like his father. Even if Hakim tries to come back to Sadr, Sadr will never receive his hand.&lt;/span&gt;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If the rift between Hakim and Sadr deepens, moderate Shiites fear, all Iraqis may suffer. &quot;It should not leave any shadow on a fragile situation on Iraq,&quot; said Dabbagh, the government spokesman. &quot;Iraq cannot absorb such a shock.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116668142404926971/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116668142404926971&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116668142404926971'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116668142404926971'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/who-rules-streets.html' title='Who rules the streets?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116668043970543329</id><published>2006-12-21T00:52:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-21T00:53:59.720-05:00</updated><title type='text'>It&#39;s about justice</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/21/nyregion/21trial.html&quot;&gt;Refrain of ‘Guilty’ Ends Trial in Murder of 2 Detectives&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By MICHAEL BRICK&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 21, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;A street gang member who boasted of bloodshed and invincibility in his amateur rap lyrics was found guilty yesterday of capital murder for shooting two undercover detectives in the back of the head during a weapons sting on Staten Island.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The convicted man, Ronell Wilson, 24, known by the street name Rated R, cocked his head to watch sidelong and deadpan as the jury foreman announced the verdict, which could lead to his death by lethal injection. The same anonymous panel will reconvene next month in Federal District Court in Brooklyn to decide whether to impose a death sentence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The verdict, after three and a half years of legal machinations, concluded an agonizing chapter for the Police Department. The two detectives, James V. Nemorin and Rodney J. Andrews, were killed on March 10, 2003, the first two officers killed by gunfire in a single day since 1988.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly called the decision a victory for police officers and for the people of New York. “They need to know that cop killers will be brought to justice,” he said in a written statement, adding that he hoped the verdict would provide a measure of comfort to the detectives’ families. “We will never forget them or their sacrifice.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why didn&#39;t people march about this?

SWARNS&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 21, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;W&lt;blockquote&gt;ASHINGTON, Dec. 20 — In a letter sent to hundreds of voters this month, Representative Virgil H. Goode Jr., Republican of Virginia, warned that the recent election of the first Muslim to Congress posed a serious threat to the nation’s traditional values.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Representative Virgil H. Goode Jr., left, said Keith Ellison’s decision to use a Koran in a private swearing in for the House of Representatives was a mistake.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Goode was referring to Keith Ellison, the Minnesota Democrat and criminal defense lawyer who converted to Islam as a college student and was elected to the House in November. Mr. Ellison’s plan to use the Koran during his private swearing-in ceremony in January had outraged some Virginia voters, prompting Mr. Goode to issue a written response to them, a spokesman for Mr. Goode said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his letter, which was dated Dec. 5, Mr. Goode said that Americans needed to “wake up” or else there would “likely be many more Muslims elected to office and demanding the use of the Koran.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies that I believe are necessary to preserve the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America and to prevent our resources from being swamped,” said Mr. Goode, who vowed to use the Bible when taking his own oath of office.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Goode declined Wednesday to comment on his letter, which quickly stirred a furor among some Congressional Democrats and Muslim Americans, who accused him of bigotry and intolerance. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why don&#39;t you tell the men and women on Ward 57 and the parents of the dead how unpatriotic Muslims serving in the US Army have been.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fuck you, Congressman.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116668026758440115/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116668026758440115&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116668026758440115'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116668026758440115'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/good-enough-to-die-in-iraq.html' title='Good enough to die in Iraq.'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116665847168019282</id><published>2006-12-20T18:28:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-20T18:55:14.916-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The babbling of idiots</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/666517/burn.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/106274/burn.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You know, it&#39;s kind of amusing to listen to people like Max Boot and Michelle Malkin babble about shit they do not understand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I have fucking had it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When people use the comparisons to Vietnam, they miss one central point. The US ALWAYS had enough combat power to save their asses in a jam. John Paul Vann made a NVA battalion disappear under a sea of Arc Light strikes outside Pleiku in 1972.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Twisted motherfucker that he was, he had the power of the US behind him.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Look at the ridiculous fucking debate we&#39;re having: whether to attack Sadr or not. Uh, why are we telling him this? Because no one around speaks English? What if the Sunni and the Sadrists say &quot;fuck Bush, let&#39;s attack first&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We&#39;re telling him we&#39;re coming for him. Why wouldn&#39;t he strike first?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We do not have the practical power to make JAM disappear. If they come hard, we could be fucked. Just by attacking the roads north of Basra could turn this into a fiasco. One unit defection would cripple this entire plan.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Imagine the impact of an Iraqi unit walking away from their US trainers and declairing their loyalty to the Sadrist movement.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are talking brigades when we need to discuss divisions which we don&#39;t have.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What if Sadr just kills his rivals before Bush&#39;s incompetent plotting takes effect. What happens then?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kagan, Kristol, all these assclowns who precidict easy victory, even now, don&#39;t get that the US could leave Iraq with thousands more dead and Sadr in charge.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is the worst option, the worst plan, and the media reports it as if it isn&#39;t insane. Jesus fucking Christ. What the fuck is wrong with these people. Bush was clearly being led to leave Iraq, he now has given the entire country a massive fuck you.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sistani, timid until the end, stupidly draws a line against Sadr as if he&#39;s a neer do well. He is anything but.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Failure. Do these people think of how to plan for failure? No, they fail and ignore it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bush cannot survive this. He will not see 2008 as president. He will be forced from office in disgrace. He has created a confrontation, and this Congress will have to meet it or hand him a crown and walk away.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116665847168019282/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116665847168019282&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116665847168019282'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116665847168019282'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/babbling-of-idiots.html' title='The babbling of idiots'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116665388600060078</id><published>2006-12-20T17:29:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-20T17:31:26.056-05:00</updated><title type='text'>One more gift to give</title><content type='html'>&lt;h2&gt;           &lt;a class=&quot;post-title&quot; href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/12/20/give-the-gift-of-digby/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent Link to Give the Gift of Digby&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;a class=&quot;post-title&quot; href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/12/20/give-the-gift-of-digby/&quot; rel=&quot;bookmark&quot; title=&quot;Permanent Link to Give the Gift of Digby&quot;&gt;             Give the Gift of Digby          &lt;/a&gt;         &lt;/h2&gt;          &lt;!-- Print the time the article was posted --&gt;          &lt;div class=&quot;post-author&quot;&gt;By &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/index.php?author=1&quot;&gt;Jane Hamsher&lt;/a&gt; @ 1:59 pm&lt;/div&gt;          &lt;!-- The article content --&gt;         &lt;div class=&quot;post-content&quot;&gt;           &lt;p&gt;&lt;img id=&quot;image6209&quot; src=&quot;http://static.firedoglake.com/2006/12/87c2ff3a-1f42-4eed-82a9-1519af49a55b.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;87c2ff3a-1f42-4eed-82a9-1519af49a55b.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Digby is having a &lt;a href=&quot;http://digbysblog.blogspot.com/2006_12_01_digbysblog_archive.html#116664919721241974&quot;&gt;fundraiser&lt;/a&gt; over at Hullaballu.

But we keep chugging along.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are in a very dangerous time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This surge bullshit, it&#39;s neither a surge or escalation, but reenforcing current units, is all about going after Sadr. Which will fail. Like trying to smash jello with a mallet. They are going to try and attack Sadr, who is a fucking folk hero to most Iraqis, who are Shia, while the Sunni insurgents are free to roam about the country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jean Larteguy described the kind of officer Bush is relying upon, the kind who would rather be in camoflauge in the jungle with his men, than shining his general&#39;s turds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, it may be seductive to listen to Dave Petreus, Pete Chiarelli and Harry McMasters. They are fine men and fine leaders. But they have failed and do not see their own failures. They think they can refight the war as if Sadr and his team, and the Sunnis are little more than monkeys. They&#39;re media savvy, well trained and &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;lavishly&lt;/span&gt; armed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They are problem solvers. But this is not a problem to be solved.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no one more push, no one more effort to get Iraqis on &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;our&lt;/span&gt; side. Sadr, for good or ill, despite fumbling on camera, represents a dedicated movement of millions of people who will die to protect their faith.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What few troops which actually hit the battlefield will quickly be swallowed up. Bush ignored the ISG report, even the most conservative DOD  reports to embrace the most reckless plan possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He needs more troops? Look for some kind of draft to hit Congress next year. Not Charlie Rangel&#39;s spite draft, but releasing ROTC to the Army or federalizing the reserves. If Bush can still go after Social Security after the defeat of the GOP, he can do anything.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Because Bush, like a degenerate gambler, cannot resist betting higher and losing more.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congress, from day one, has got to demand answers about these plans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What happens when units start refusing assignments?

His departure could clear way for a more aggressive strategy.&lt;br /&gt;By Peter Spiegel, Times Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;December 20, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON — Army Gen. John P. Abizaid, commander of U.S. forces in the Middle East, has submitted plans to retire and will leave his post in March, a step likely to make way for a change in military strategy at a time the Bush administration is seeking a new plan for Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abizaid has been the primary architect of U.S. military strategy in Iraq and Afghanistan since becoming head of the U.S. Central Command more than three years ago. He has strenuously resisted calls to increase troop levels to quell rising violence in Baghdad, arguing it would increase Iraqi dependence on Americans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But a growing number of current and former officers have embraced the idea, some of whom have briefed President Bush as part of his monthlong review of Iraq policy, and the White House is believed to be considering the move.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;If you&#39;re going to change the strategy, in fairness to [Abizaid], let him go,&quot; said a former senior Pentagon official who has worked closely with the general. &quot;He&#39;s given it all he&#39;s got, in terms of personal sacrifice.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abizaid&#39;s planned departure clears the way for new Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates to recommend his own commander, a decision current and former Defense officials say is nearly as important as the new administration strategy expected to be unveiled by Bush in January.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These officials said Gates faces a clear choice between generals who have agreed with Abizaid&#39;s push to quickly hand over security responsibilities to Iraqi forces and a small but increasingly influential coterie of officers backing a more aggressive U.S.-led counterinsurgency campaign.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to Defense officials, Abizaid submitted his retirement documents just over a month ago, shortly before Donald H. Rumsfeld was pushed out as Defense secretary. One recently retired Army general said Abizaid had wanted to retire earlier but that Rumsfeld blocked the move, insisting his war commanders stay in place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Going to war isn&#39;t like having a regular job,&quot; said the retired general, who, like the others, spoke on condition of anonymity because Abizaid&#39;s plans had not been made public. &quot;It&#39;s extremely stressful, it&#39;s heavily responsible. I can understand why he&#39;d want to retire.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Abizaid&#39;s four-year term as chief of the Central Command, or Centcom, was to end in July. But some close to the Army have speculated in recent weeks that his term might be extended to see through implementation of the administration&#39;s new Iraq strategy. However, a Centcom spokesman said that earlier this year, Rumsfeld asked Abizaid to stay only until &quot;early 2007.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;He does not intend to extend beyond that period,&quot; the spokesman said. &quot;Gen. Abizaid became commander in July 2003 and has served longer in this position than any previous commander.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Gates&#39; search for a successor, the candidate most closely associated with Abizaid&#39;s strategy is Army Gen. George W. Casey Jr., the commander of U.S. forces in Iraq, who is also expected to leave his current assignment early next year. Although Casey was considered the favorite to become the next Army chief of staff under Rumsfeld, Gates could decide to move him to the Central Command for continuity, officials said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critics of the current war effort say making Casey either chief of staff or Centcom commander would send the wrong signal — essentially endorsing a strategy that the president acknowledges has failed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It would be a terrible thing,&quot; said one military analyst with close ties to the Pentagon. &quot;He&#39;s the guy who&#39;s losing the war.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The leading candidate from the counterinsurgency advocates is Army Lt. Gen. David Petraeus, a highly respected military thinker who led the 101st Airborne Division during the Iraq invasion in March 2003.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In his current job as head of the Army&#39;s leading military schools, Petraeus oversaw the rewriting of the Army and Marine counterinsurgency field manual, which was issued last week and argues that while killing insurgents is often important, the most vital task in a counterinsurgency is winning the support of the population.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The manual also argues for moving soldiers out of large bases into smaller outposts among the local population. Such manpower-intensive tactics run counter to those now used by Abizaid and Casey. Currently, troops clear dangerous Baghdad neighborhoods with regularity but, because of their limited numbers, must quickly turn over long-term security responsibilities to unprepared Iraqi units, which frequently results in backsliding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Army Lt. Gen. Peter Chiarelli, who last week left Iraq as the head of day-to-day military operations, is also closely associated with such tactics, having implemented them when he was commander of the 1st Cavalry Division in Baghdad&#39;s Shiite slums. He is also seen as a top counterinsurgency candidate if Petraeus is chosen for another job in Iraq, such as replacing Casey.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God, these guys, McMaster, Chiarelli, Petreus, remind me of the French Para generals in Algeria. They don&#39;t get that no matter what tricks you come up with, you cannot win. Smaller bases? Please&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tal Afar was an illusion. Half the time McMaster had to keep the Sunnis and Shia from each other&#39;s throats.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116660852214365230/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116660852214365230&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116660852214365230'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116660852214365230'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/abizaid-to-retire.html' title='Abizaid to retire'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116660200063817082</id><published>2006-12-20T03:01:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-20T03:06:40.683-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Why people follow Sadr</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/images/realcities/krwashington/16276/264917094248.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://www.mercurynews.com/images/realcities/krwashington/16276/264917094248.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Maha Adel Mehdi, 32, is an Iraqi legislator &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;representing Shiite cleric and militia commander &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Muqtada al Sadr.

She&#39;d ached to hear a voice - just one - that dared to criticize the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein and the policies that stifled the dreams of her generation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mehdi found her &quot;light of righteousness&quot; in Grand Ayatollah Mohammed Mohammed Sadeq al-Sadr, a Shiite Muslim cleric who openly called for political reform and religious freedom until he was killed in a hail of gunfire, along with two of his sons, in 1999.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;There was something in his voice I couldn&#39;t resist. I found myself listening until the very end. His speeches were something different,&quot; Mehdi recalled. &quot;At the time, I needed someone to set me on the right path. Sadr did that.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Millions of Shiites sought solace in Sadr&#39;s words, but Mehdi&#39;s story was different: She was a Sunni Muslim when she first heard Sadr&#39;s call. Now a 32-year-old mother of two, Mehdi is still serving Sadr, as one of the 11 female legislators loyal to his son, Muqtada al-Sadr, whose Mahdi Army militia is at the forefront of Iraq&#39;s violence.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mehdi prides herself on the rebellious streak that compelled her to give up her family, her sect and her safety to begin a new life. Her journey helps explain the broad appeal of a militant movement that&#39;s able to turn even the unlikeliest of supporters into devotees prepared to face death.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I read many books until I reached a very clear point that the Shiite way is my way,&quot; Mehdi said. &quot;I am ready to sacrifice my life for this path.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critics accuse the younger Sadr of sullying his father&#39;s reputation by sending adolescents to their deaths in two bloody uprisings against U.S. forces, fielding death squads to carry out revenge attacks on Sunnis and turning the family&#39;s venerated name into a synonym for thuggery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Diehard followers such as Mehdi, however, view the younger Sadr&#39;s brand of resistance as a natural words-to-deeds progression of his father&#39;s defiance. Now, however, the cause isn&#39;t toppling a dictator but driving out the American troops who once were hailed as liberators. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116660200063817082/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116660200063817082&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116660200063817082'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116660200063817082'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/why-people-follow-sadr.html' title='Why people follow Sadr'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116658996964450079</id><published>2006-12-20T01:44:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-19T23:46:09.660-05:00</updated><title type='text'>No shit</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/519992/_39640629_medcenter_ap203.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/588118/_39640629_medcenter_ap203.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/19/AR2006121901659.html&quot;&gt; Repeat Iraq Tours Raise Risk of PTSD, Army Finds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Ann Scott Tyson&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, December 20, 2006; Page A19&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;U.S. soldiers serving repeated Iraq deployments are 50 percent more likely than those with one tour to suffer from acute combat stress, raising their risk of post-traumatic stress disorder, according to the Army&#39;s first survey exploring how today&#39;s multiple war-zone rotations affect soldiers&#39; mental health.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;More than 650,000 soldiers have deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001 -- including more than 170,000 now in the Army who have served multiple tours -- so the survey&#39;s finding of increased risk from repeated exposure to combat has potentially widespread implications for the all-volunteer force. Earlier Army studies have shown that up to 30 percent of troops deployed to Iraq suffer from depression, anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with the latter accounting for about 10 percent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The findings reflect the fact that some soldiers -- many of whom are now spending only about a year at home between deployments -- are returning to battle while still suffering from the psychological scars of earlier combat tours, the report said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;When we look at combat, we look at some very horrific events,&quot; said Col. Ed Crandell, head of the Army&#39;s Mental Health Advisory Team, which polled 1,461 soldiers in Iraq in late 2005. &quot;They come back, they know they&#39;re going to deploy again,&quot; and as a result they don&#39;t ever return to normal levels of stress, Crandell said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Overall, soldiers in Iraq are facing a greater exposure to some key traumatic events than in the past, according to the report, the Army&#39;s third mental health survey conducted in Iraq since 2003. Seventy-six percent of soldiers surveyed, for example, said they knew someone who had been seriously injured or killed, and 55 percent experienced the explosion of a roadside bomb or booby trap nearby.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The proportion of soldiers who reported that they suffered a combination of anxiety, depression and acute stress rose to 17 percent, compared with 13 percent in the last survey in 2004.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Fourteen percent of soldiers surveyed said they have taken medications, such as antidepressants, for mental health problems.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Combat stress is significantly higher among soldiers with at least one previous tour -- 18.4 percent, compared with 12.5 percent of those on their first deployment, the survey found.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116658996964450079/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116658996964450079&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116658996964450079'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116658996964450079'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/no-shit.html' title='No shit'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116658888812073212</id><published>2006-12-20T01:26:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-19T23:33:03.566-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Jen,  still want the turducken?</title><content type='html'>&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/12/19/dining/20hams450.2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/12/19/dining/20hams450.2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/20/dining/20hams.html&quot;&gt;Fanfare for the City Ham, a Country Cousin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By MATT LEE and TED LEE&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 20, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;TO Southerners like us, the apotheosis of pork is country ham — the hind leg of a pig that has been immersed in rock salt, hung in a smokehouse, then aged for many months to prosciutto-like firmness. We have hallowed country ham in national magazines, clucked over the decline of its mostly artisanal production and driven close to a thousand miles for a particularly fine Kentucky specimen. We have spent more on these hams in some years than we have on health insurance. We’ve even given them as wedding gifts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So our dirty little secret, the one that may cost us our invitation to the next Southern Foodways Symposium, is that we are not, in fact, pork purists: we’re suckers for a glazed baked ham, those brine-plumped, brown-sugar-encrusted pork bombs that anchor the buffet line in all 50 states at this time of year. Their rosy sheen, firm salt quotient, flaky texture, sweet edge and bacony, clove-scented flavor invariably bring us back to the table for thirds and fourths. There, we’ve said it: we love regular baked ham.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We were surprised (and perhaps even vindicated) by our recent odyssey through the best of New York City’s homegrown hams — city ham, if you will. Where a country ham might be cured for weeks in dry salt, then smoked, then aged for a year (or two), city hams seem like a shortcut. They are soaked in or injected with a brine of water, salt and sugar before being cooked and then smoked for a few hours. The whole process may take less than two days.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As you might expect, there are differences in taste and texture, too. Country hams have the leathery texture of serrano ham and an earthy flavor that comes from long aging. But in many cases, the New York hams we tasted — and we sampled more than 25 of them, from 10 producers — delivered pork sensations every bit as nuanced, rich and magnificent as their country kin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tucked away at the back of meat markets that blend in with storefront real-estate agencies and baby boutiques or in low-rise industrial buildings in residential neighborhoods, the smokehouses of New York City tend to be invisible, their secret discernible only upon stepping through the front door and deeply inhaling. And, in fact, some producers seem to prefer it that way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I don’t show anybody what we do,” said Jerry Kurowycky (pronounced kur-VITZ-kee), the owner of Kurowycky Meat Products, as he ushered us past refrigerator cases of hot mustard and Polish butter at the front of his store, on First Avenue in the East Village. “But I’m happy to give you a general idea.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So we followed Mr. Kurowycky, who on a balmy December day wore shorts and flip-flops, through a narrow passageway to a tiled preparation area with a brick floor. Recessed into the back wall were four soot-black smoking chambers with heavy iron double-doors. A shovel leaned against a large paper bag of hardwood chips at one end of the room.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Kurowycky, whose grandfather Erast bought the store from a former employer in 1955, claims he makes hams exactly the way his grandfather did in the Ukraine before World War II, by hand-rubbing fresh hams with salt and sodium nitrite, then letting them cure in pans for two weeks. He then rinses them, cooks them for six hours, and hangs them in the smoker overnight. Finally, they are glazed with brown sugar. “But that’s strictly for decoration,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Kurowycky’s ham may be unique among the city hams we sampled for its dry cure; most cured hams today are immersed in or injected with a liquid brine, which speeds the process.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Indeed, his ham appeared a shade drier and more muscular than the wet-brined New York City hams we tasted, but its silky texture and prominent smoke flavor stood out, too. It had a decent layer of fat and some marbling, with a sweet nuttiness, and an appetizing but unobtrusive saltiness.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116658888812073212/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116658888812073212&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116658888812073212'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116658888812073212'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/jen-still-want-turducken.html' title='Jen,  still want the turducken?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116659567185415530</id><published>2006-12-20T01:13:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-20T01:21:11.896-05:00</updated><title type='text'>This is fucked up</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061219/2006_12_19t131201_354x450_us_life_beauty.jpg?x=271&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=hM9Nn0_CSyvQCDSrSfIyJw--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/nm/20061219/2006_12_19t131201_354x450_us_life_beauty.jpg?x=271&amp;y=345&amp;amp;sig=hM9Nn0_CSyvQCDSrSfIyJw--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/news/story/481300p-405048c.html&quot;&gt;She won&#39;t be Miss-ed&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tara&#39;s reign will continue, Trump sez&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Miss USA Tara Conner, who had come under criticism amid rumors she had been frequenting bars while underage, will be allowed to keep her title, Donald Trump announced Tuesday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’ve always been a believer in second chances,” Trump, who owns the Miss Universe Organization with NBC, said with Conner at his side.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He said he and Conner met earlier Tuesday morning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“She left a small town in Kentucky and she was telling me that she got caught up in the whirlwind of New York,” Trump said. “It’s a story that has happened many times before to many women and many men who came to the Big Apple. They wanted their slice of the Big Apple and they found out it wasn’t so easy.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conner won the title in April and has been living in New York. Recent media accounts of heavy drinking brought a storm of criticism, since she was underage at the time. She turned 21 on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a tear-choked voice, Conner said, “In no way did I think it would be possible for a second chance to be given to me.” Turning to Trump, she said, “You’ll never know what this means to me, and I swear I will not let you down.” Trump said Conner would be entering rehab.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If she had been dethroned, her title would have been taken over by first runner-up Miss California Tamiko Nash.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Conner, a 5-foot-5 blonde, has been competing in pageants since age 4. After winning the Miss USA title in April, she finished fourth in the Miss Universe pageant in July.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Donald Trump sank even below his own lowest standards by humiliating that girl.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She&#39;s from a small town, they cut her loose in New York, what the fuck did they think was going to happen? It happens at NYU and Columbia every fucking year.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And so how does Trump handle it? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He fucking humiliates her in  a crass, evil way for doing what unsupervised kids do.

Here&#39;s one: Nina Frazier of New Braunfels, Texas, asks: If you believe in the war, why didn&#39;t you encourage your own daughters to fight for your country? Or did you?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;THE PRESIDENT: I believe Americans can contribute to the security and well-being of our country in a variety of ways. That&#39;s why we have a volunteer army. What we say to young people is that if you want to serve your country you can do so in the military, or you can do so by teaching children in inner-city Washington, D.C., like one of our daughters did. Or you can help form education programs in New York City, like our (other) daughter. There are all kinds of ways to serve.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Later, a follow-up, of sorts:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Are your daughters coming home for Christmas?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Mrs. Bush: They are. Jenna is working with an international organization in Central and South America about education policy. And Barbara is working for a museum in the education department.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116654666860343996/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116654666860343996&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116654666860343996'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116654666860343996'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/question.html' title='The question'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116654583013368843</id><published>2006-12-19T11:25:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-19T11:30:30.346-05:00</updated><title type='text'>All is well</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/9211/iraqimilitias.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/681777/iraqimilitias.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/washingtondc/la-fg-zawraa19dec19,1,2800013.story?page=1&amp;ctrack=1&amp;amp;cset=true&quot;&gt; Iraqi TV station plays up U.S. losses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Borzou Daragahi and Molly Hennessy-Fiske, Times Staff Writers&lt;br /&gt;December 19, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BAGHDAD — The men with laptops sat around an unadorned conference table, chatting amicably about their plans and operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The scene on the newly launched Al Zawraa satellite television channel could have been footage from the boardroom of any company, if it weren&#39;t for the ski masks the men wore and the subject of the meeting: future mortar attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The renegade, pro-insurgent Al Zawraa channel, with a 24-hour diet of propaganda against U.S. forces and the Iraqi government, has become something of a sensation throughout the country. It has drawn condemnation from U.S. officials, Iraqi politicians and Friday prayer leaders.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most hours of the day it plays footage of U.S. soldiers in Iraq being shot and blown up in insurgent attacks, often with religious chants or Saddam Hussein-era nationalist anthems in the background. There are segments warning Iraq&#39;s Sunni Arabs to be wary of Shiite Muslims, and occasional English-language commentary and subtitles clearly meant to demoralize U.S. troops.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&quot;Your new enlisting qualifications are kind of comical,&quot; an announcer says in slightly accented American English, over an image of a U.S. soldier in a field hospital, a bandage on his newly amputated arm. &quot;I mean, what are you doing? Thirty-nine years old? That&#39;s the new age of recruiting? Are you recruiting nannies? I guess if we are patient, we might witness crippled people enlisting for the Marines.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The station attempts to present an alternative to images of the war appearing in U.S. and other Iraqi media. It shows footage of Americans abusing Iraqis and Baghdad government officials collaborating with the &quot;occupier.&quot; Even Michael Moore&#39;s &quot;Fahrenheit 911,&quot; the 2004 documentary critical of the Bush administration&#39;s foreign policy, gets drawn into the commentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;After all, there are honest guys in America,&quot; the announcer says in comments directed at President Bush. &quot;If Mr. Moore can talk to you like that, so can I.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not clear how big an Iraqi audience Al Zawraa captures. But its very presence demonstrates the insurgency&#39;s abilities. Despite 140,000 U.S. troops in Iraq and intense diplomatic pressure on Iraq&#39;s neighbors, the station is able to circumvent U.S. and Iraqi forces and stage round-the-clock broadcasts, complete with news bulletins, graphics and commentary.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Al Zawraa started out several months ago as an aboveground hard-line Sunni channel, but it was shut down by the Iraqi government Nov. 5, the day Hussein received the death penalty. Iraqi police raided the station&#39;s headquarters after broadcasts criticized the verdict.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the time, Mishaan Jaburi, a member of parliament said to be behind the station, disputed the sanction.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;If Saddam had ordered the killing of some hundreds of Iraqi people, the current officials in Baghdad deserve 1,000 death sentences because they cause the daily killing of more than those killed by Saddam,&quot; Jaburi, who has been accused of embezzling state funds, told the Associated Press from Syria.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Maliki had warned stations in July not to broadcast footage that would jeopardize the nation&#39;s stability. But the attempt to stifle Al Zawraa backfired. It quickly reemerged as an underground station with violent, no-holds-barred content clearly meant to incite Sunnis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Broadcast staples include images of U.S. soldiers manhandling Iraqi women, photos from the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal and footage of Iraqi children burned and injured in alleged U.S. attacks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is just fucked up</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116654583013368843/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116654583013368843&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116654583013368843'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116654583013368843'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/all-is-well.html' title='All is well'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116654419595309785</id><published>2006-12-19T10:59:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-19T11:03:15.993-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Who are they kidding?</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/130880/kerik_giuliani.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/347317/kerik_giuliani.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hahahahahahaha&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/18/AR2006121801410.html&quot;&gt;Giuliani&#39;s Primary Hurdle&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Polls Aside, Skeptics Say GOP Won&#39;t Nominate a Social Liberal for President&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Michael Powell and Chris Cillizza&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Staff Writers&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, December 19, 2006; Page A01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;NEW YORK, Dec. 18 -- His national poll numbers are a dream, he&#39;s a major box office draw on the Republican Party circuit, and he goes by the shorthand title &quot;America&#39;s Mayor.&quot; All of which has former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani convinced he just might become America&#39;s president in 2008.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He is showing the early signs of a serious candidacy: Giuliani&#39;s presidential exploratory committee throws its first major fundraiser in a hotel near Times Square on Tuesday evening, and he recently hired the political director of the Republican National Committee during 2006. A Washington Post-ABC News poll released last week found that Republicans give Giuliani an early lead over Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who is far ahead of the former mayor in organizing a national campaign.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;Despite that lead, conservative party strategists and activists in key primary states are skeptical and warn that the socially liberal Republican faces a difficult campaign. They question whether a Republican who has had one marriage end in annulment and another in divorce, and favors abortion rights, gun control and immigrant rights, has much retail appeal in the evangelical and deeply conservative reaches of the GOP.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;If the Republican Party wants to send the social conservatives home for good, all they have to do is nominate Rudy Giuliani,&quot; said Rick Scarborough, a Southern Baptist minister and president of Vision America. &quot;It&#39;s an insult to the pro-Christian agenda. . . . He&#39;s going to spend a lot of money finding he can&#39;t get out of the Republican primaries.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Giuliani is reticent about how he would overcome these obstacles -- he declined to be interviewed before the fundraisers, which are closed to the news media. But members of his intensely loyal inner circle said they expect him to run and campaign aggressively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His strategy will be to capitalize on his status as a tough and plain-talking hero of Sept. 11, 2001. He believes, say advisers, that his tough views on national security -- he supports the USA Patriot Act -- and on Iraq, where he opposes withdrawal of troops, will overshadow his liberal social views. He will frame some of those positions as libertarian -- government has no business interfering in the bedroom.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Many Republicans say no. The party has grown steadily disenchanted with liberal members of the party, and it was Republican moderates in the Northeast who suffered many losses in last month&#39;s elections.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;For us to nominate him, we have to say those issues are not really important to us [and] we care more about winning regardless of the philosophy of our candidate,&quot; GOP consultant Curt Anderson said. &quot;I don&#39;t believe that a majority of Republican primary voters will make that choice.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in a measure of the party&#39;s divisions, other Republicans, such as California financier Bill Simon and talk show host Dennis Prager, say his social liberalism is of less concern. They are among a group of conservative activists who see in Giuliani a Reagan-like figure, sometimes wrong but possessed of unshakable conservative beliefs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;You mean the two mistresses, the payoff to one and the savage way he treated his family. The more you know about Giuliani, the less you like him.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116654419595309785/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116654419595309785&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116654419595309785'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116654419595309785'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/who-are-they-kidding.html' title='Who are they kidding?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116651237483745266</id><published>2006-12-19T02:09:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-19T02:12:54.853-05:00</updated><title type='text'>God&#39;s Side</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

Describes Fired Editor’s Remarks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By SHARON WAXMAN and RICHARD SIKLOS&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 18, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18 — With Judith Regan’s authors still reeling from their publisher’s abrupt dismissal, the sparring between the headline-making Ms. Regan and her former employer, Rupert Murdoch’s News Corporation, grew more intense, more personal and more specific today over allegations of anti-Semitism.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The News Corporation released what it described as notes from a heated telephone conversation on Friday between Ms. Regan and Mark Jackson, a top lawyer for HarperCollins, the company publishing division which included her imprint, ReganBooks — a conversation that News Corporation officials said was instrumental in her dismissal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the notes, taken down by Mr. Jackson as the conversation unfolded, Ms. Regan protested that the publishing house had not supported her during last month’s firestorm over a confessional book by O.J. Simpson and related television program, which the News Corporation canceled in the wake of public protests and unease by some affiliate television stations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“‘Of all people, the Jews should know about ganging up, finding common enemies and telling the big lie,’” Ms. Regan said, according to a transcript of Mr. Jackson’s notes provided by Gary Ginsberg, an executive vice president of the News Corporation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the transcript, Ms. Regan went on to say that the literary agent Esther Newberg; HarperCollins’s executive editor, David Hirshey; HarperCollins’s president, Jane Friedman, and Mr. Jackson “constitute a Jewish cabal against her.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A lawyer for Ms. Regan, Bert Fields, denied that Ms. Regan had said there was a “Jewish cabal against her,” saying she used only the word “cabal” in the conversation, and it came in response to a question from Mr. Jackson. But he acknowledged that she had made some version of the first statement, drawing attention to the fact that her boss and others involved in the controversy over the aborted O.J. Simpson project were Jewish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He denied, though, that this reflected any anti-Semitism. “There is nothing insulting to Jewish people in saying that Jews should particularly understand what it is to be victims of the big lie,” Mr. Fields said. “They were looking for an excuse to fire her, and they fired her and called it anti-Semitic. It ain’t anti-Semitic.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;She is way over her head here,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;She is a very angry woman and she lost her judgement&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is New York business and Fields is the wrong lawyer for this. News Corp isn&#39;t playing with her after years of her antics.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116651211135566905/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116651211135566905&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116651211135566905'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116651211135566905'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/career-over.html' title='Career Over'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116651000785112303</id><published>2006-12-19T01:27:00.001-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-19T01:36:58.523-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The Clark Clifford Moment</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1948/1101480315_400.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://img.timeinc.net/time/magazine/archive/covers/1948/1101480315_400.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sec of Defense Clark Clifford&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/18/AR2006121801477.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;White House, Joint Chiefs At Odds on Adding Troops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Robin Wright and Peter Baker&lt;br /&gt;Washington Post Staff Writers&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, December 19, 2006; Page A01&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;The Bush administration is split over the idea of a surge in troops to Iraq, with White House officials aggressively promoting the concept over the unanimous disagreement of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, according to U.S. officials familiar with the intense debate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sending 15,000 to 30,000 more troops for a mission of possibly six to eight months is one of the central proposals on the table of the White House policy review to reverse the steady deterioration in Iraq. The option is being discussed as an element in a range of bigger packages, the officials said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Joint Chiefs think the White House, after a month of talks, still does not have a defined mission and is latching on to the surge idea in part because of limited alternatives, despite warnings about the potential disadvantages for the military, said the officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the White House review is not public.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The chiefs have taken a firm stand, the sources say, because they believe the strategy review will be the most important decision on Iraq to be made since the March 2003 invasion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At regular interagency meetings and in briefing President Bush last week, the Pentagon has warned that any short-term mission may only set up the United States for bigger problems when it ends. The service chiefs have warned that a short-term mission could give an enormous edge to virtually all the armed factions in Iraq -- including al-Qaeda&#39;s foreign fighters, Sunni insurgents and Shiite militias -- without giving an enduring boost to the U.S military mission or to the Iraqi army, the officials said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pentagon has cautioned that a modest surge could lead to more attacks by al-Qaeda, provide more targets for Sunni insurgents and fuel the jihadist appeal for more foreign fighters to flock to Iraq to attack U.S. troops, the officials said.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Joint Chiefs are facing the same dilemma Clifford did in 1968.

Megan McClung, a public affairs officer who became the highest-ranking woman killed in Iraq when she died two weeks ago, had been escorting Oliver North and a FOX News crew through Ramadi just moments before a roadside bomb took her life, a military spokesman told E&amp;P on Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the explosion occurred on Dec. 6, McClung was in the midst of escorting a Newsweek staffer, according to Lt. Col. Bryan Salas, a public affairs officer stationed at Camp Fallujah. He said he did not know the identity of the Newsweek employee or the reason for the escort.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;My understanding is that Newsweek was with her at the time of the explosion, in a different vehicle,&quot; Salas said. &quot;She had just dropped off the Fox News crew.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;McClung, 34, had just left North, a Fox contributor, and his crew at the Ramadi Government Center following a 10-minute escorted drive from Camp Ramadi, a U.S. Army base there, Salas said. &quot;It was her first and only escort with him,&quot; Salas told E&amp;amp;P. &quot;He was covering the Marines in Ramadi.&quot; Many journalists go out without any military escort, even in dangerous areas.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A Fox News spokesperson said she could not confirm North&#39;s involvement, while Newsweek did not immediately return a call seeking information.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Salas said McClung, who has been widely praised by former embeds since her death for her efforts to help reporters and others involved in coverage of the war, offered such escorts for a wide variety of media representatives, not just the more high-profiles such as North. &quot;It wasn&#39;t uncommon for her to escort different types of journalists,&quot; Salas said. &quot;She made her own decisions on who and where and when to escort.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Hmmmmm.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/accident-unlikely.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Accident, unlikely.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Capt. Travis Patrquin&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Officer Killed in Battle, but His Ideas Live On&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By MARTHA RADDATZ&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Dec. 15, 2006 — President Bush has spent the last few weeks engaged in complex briefings with senior military officers, State Department officials and outside experts as he tries to come up with a new plan to achieve victory in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  But a young captain serving in Iraq&#39;s violent Al Anbar Province has offered a simple explanation of what the problem was in Iraq and how to solve it. Among his observations is the importance of having a moustache in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  In a military known for its sleep-inducing, graphically dizzying PowerPoint presentations, the young captain&#39;s presentation, which has been unofficially circulating through the ranks, stands out. Using stick figures and simple language, it articulates the same goal as the president&#39;s in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  The creator of this PowerPoint presentation, &quot;How to Win in Al Anbar,&quot; was Capt. Travis Patriquin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  But Patriquin will not see victory in Iraq. He was killed by the same improvised explosive device that killed Maj. Megan McClung of the Marine Corps last Wednesday.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So why was an Army Captain with her when she died?</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116650906250658475/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116650906250658475&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116650906250658475'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116650906250658475'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/what-really-happened.html' title='What really happened?'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116650856869176299</id><published>2006-12-19T01:04:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-19T01:09:28.716-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Stating the obvious</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/614487/mahdiarmy2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/555821/mahdiarmy2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailykos.com/story/2006/12/18/112647/99&quot;&gt; The Iraq Catch-22 &lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by L C Johnson&lt;br /&gt;Mon Dec 18, 2006 at 08:33:32 AM PST&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;by&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Larry C Johnson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;  Regardless of your feelings or beliefs about sending more U.S troops to Iraq, you must accept the painful truth that anything we do to salvage or strengthen the existing Shia-dominated government in Iraq redounds to the benefit of Iran.  If we weigh in on the side of the Sunni insurgents we run a serious risk that the Shias will attack us in strength and, at least for the short time, cut our supply lines that run through the heart of Shia territory.  Moreover, anything we do to militarily challenge Iran will weaken our influence in Iraq and jeopardize the mission of our forces in Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;George Bush has made his choice and it is calamitous.  He rejected out of hand the proposal to &quot;Go Home&quot;.  And dismissed the &quot;Go Long&quot; course of action, which would have emphasized counterinsurgency, public works vice combat, and diplomatic overtures to Iran and Syria.  Instead, he has thrown his weight behind &quot;Go Strong&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The key elements of the &quot;go strong&quot; plan are outlined in the accompanying analysis by Pat Lang (see Stalingrad on the Tigris?).  What is not yet announced, but implicit in the plan, is a direct attack on Moqtada al Sadr and his militia, the Jayshi al Mahdi (JAM).  During their meeting in Jordan last month, George Bush reportedly told Maliki in no uncertain terms that he would have to separate himself from al Sadr or become a casualty in the upcoming offensive against the bearded cleric.  Ironically, Moqtada al Sadr has discouraged sectartian strife rather than egged it on and, among the various Shia clerics, is more receptive to working with Sunni counterparts to rebuild Iraq.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is no surprise that Maliki returned to Iraq and is making a desperate bid to align himself now with Hakim and the &quot;moderates&quot; in the current government and is signaling he will abandon al Sadr.  Bush, in his zeal for a deal in Iraq, is either ignorant or oblivious to the fact the al Hakim (a recent visitor to the White House) is closely aligned with Iran; in contrast to al Sadr who is more independent.  Notwithstanding these facts the &quot;&#39;Decider&#39;-in-Chief&quot; has rolled the dice and will try to rub out Sadr&#39;s JAM.  He also is betting he can do so without provoking a full-scale revolt among the Shia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ah, but here&#39;s the rub.  When you attack al Sadr you elevate his status.  He becomes the face of the Iraqi opposition.  Unlike the Jordanian Zarqawi, who met his end in June, a martyred al Sadr becomes more powerful in life than in death.  It is not a question of &quot;will the Shia retaliate&quot;?  They will.  And in the process U.S. forces will once again &quot;make&quot; news destroying neighborhoods and civilians in Sadr City as the insurgent forces melt away; just as we did and they did in Fallujah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But unlike Fallujah, the Shia can hurt us and hurt us bad.  The vast majority of the supplies--the food, water, bullets, and bandages--sustaining our troops in Iraq flow from Kuwait in the south along the highway the runs through the middle of Shia-controlled territory in Iraq.  If the Shia retaliate, as they have in the past, our lines of communication will be in jeopardy, at least over the short term.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This is more serious than going without toliet paper for a couple of days.  With the anticipated surge in troops to Baghdad the logistics demands will increase.  That makes the supplies from the south more, not less, critical.  The tactical challenge of keeping the resupply line open is daunting.  In June of this year one in every 20 convoys was attacked while heading from Kuwait to Baghdad.  Now that figure is approaching one in every five.  Most of these attacks appear to be the work of criminal gangs intent on filling their pockets.  But the ease and frequency of these attacks should keep military commanders up at night.  A concerted effort could effectively shut down our resupply effort.  Any one remember Jessica Lynch and her ill-fated colleagues?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also need to accept the fact that the ethnic partitioning of Iraq is underway and the battle is focused in and around Baghdad.  The Shia essentially control the east half of Baghdad.  The Sunni control the west half.  Scattered throughout the city (but primarily on the outer suburbs) are mixed Sunni/Shia neighborhoods.  That&#39;s where the fighting is occuring   So far the Shia appear to have the upper hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Early last week President Bush was touting the body count of insurgents and implying things were getting better in Iraq.  But he failed to report that notwithstanding the insurgent bodies we are stacking up that the level of violence has continued to soar.  The last three months in Iraq--September, October, and November--have been the most violent since George Bush announced Mission Accomplished.  And December is on track to keep pace with this disturbing trend.  With more troops headed into the fray more of our boys and girls will be added to the casualty lists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now that Bush has taken the Go Home and Go Long options off of the table we also should acknowledge that whether intended or not (and I believe it was intentional) the President has tied Bob Gates&#39; hands, much to the relief of the neo-cons.   Gates faces a senior military leadership roiled by dissent and disgust.  Many are appalled that they are being blamed for the fiasco in Iraq because they followed the orders and dictates of Bush and his political appointees.  Some, like Pete Schoomacher, have seized the initiative and are going to speak candidly without regard to the effect on their careers.  Schoomacher, who was called back from retirement, really does not give a shit if he is rocking the boat as long as he his certain that he is acting in the best interest of his soldiers and his country.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am waiting for the Congress to wake up and realize that no one in the military has done an assessment of our &quot;progress&quot; in the war.  So far the only written assessments have come from the CIA and the National Intelligence Council.  No one in either CENTCOM, SOCOM, JCS, or DIA appears to have done an analysis of the trends.  If they have it is the best protected secret in the U.S. Governement.  I think the Generals learned from the fate of the two CIA station chiefs who provided their stark assessment in the early days of the insurgency (they sent back what is known as an AARDWOLF) about the disastrous course of the war and wound up losing their jobs.  So much for rewarding candor.  The military leadership got the message and has shied away from putting in writing what many concede in private to be the case.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now the focus is on Iraq, but do not imagine for a second that the neo-cons and their patrons in the Bush Administration have given up their quest to take down Iran.  The dream is alive.  Iran is the longterm obsession.  What the Bushies in their zeal fail to realize is that their efforts to get control over events in Iraq are destined to backfire and will make it more difficult to contain the threat they claim we face from Iran.  Bush and Cheney don&#39;t have a learning curve, it is a flat line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116650856869176299/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116650856869176299&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116650856869176299'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116650856869176299'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/stating-obvious.html' title='Stating the obvious'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116650807097015958</id><published>2006-12-19T00:58:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-19T01:01:11.066-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The Paradox</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/804132/24iraq-medical2.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/742222/24iraq-medical2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;header1&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cnn.com/POLITICS/blogs/politicalticker/2006/12/cnn-poll-us-support-for-iraq-war-falls.html&quot;&gt;CNN poll: U.S. support for Iraq war falls to 31 percent&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        &lt;!--&lt;div class=&quot;small&quot;&gt;from Alexander Mooney&lt;/div&gt;--&gt;                 &lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Fewer than a third of Americans still support the war in Iraq, and more than half say they want U.S. troops out of the country within a year, according to a CNN poll released Monday.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Support for the conflict fell to a new low of 31 percent in the poll, conducted Friday through Sunday by Opinion Research Corporation, while a record 67 percent expressed opposition to the nearly 4-year-old war.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nearly three-quarters said Bush administration policy needs a complete overhaul or major changes. But only 11 percent of those polled backed calls to send more American troops to Iraq, as President Bush is said to be considering.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Pollsters interviewed 1,019 adults for the survey, which had a sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But only 32 percent of those questioned in Monday&#39;s poll said they would support keeping U.S. troops in Iraq &quot;as long as necessary&quot; to hand over control to a new Iraqi government.

They’re trapped here in a demoralizing, overcrowded environment with adults who are mostly broke, jobless and at the end of their emotional tethers. Many of the kids aren’t even going to school.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is a terrible environment for children,” said Anita Gentris, who lost everything in the flood that followed Hurricane Katrina and is living in one of the 200-square-foot travel trailers with her 10-year-old daughter and 5-year-old son. “My daughter is having bad dreams. And my son, he’s a very angry child right now. He cries. He throws things.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I’m desperately trying to find permanent housing.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The television cameras are mostly gone now, and the many thousands of people from the Gulf Coast whose lives were wrecked by Katrina in the summer of 2005 have slipped from the national consciousness. But like the city of New Orleans itself, most of them have yet to recover.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/12/18/katrina/index.html&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not in my backyard, either&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the poor kids next door took advantage of me, I felt sympathy for the people of Houston, who&#39;ve suffered crime and violence because of struggling Katrina exiles.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By Debra J. Dickerson&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Neighborhood gossip, to which I was necessarily not privy until it was too late, was that the &quot;Smiths&quot; were living in the house via Catholic Charities. Maybe it was Catholic Charities, maybe it was Section 8 -- who knows and what&#39;s the difference? In any event, and given the blur of any move, it took me a few days to notice that black people lived next door (we were the only two black families) and that a never-ending stream of children ebbed and flowed from their house at all hours of the day and night. After two weeks or so, I calculated that there were seven kids (plus one mom and four surnames) next door. Their house, like mine, has three bedrooms, one bath. It was, of course, the male teenagers that most caught my eye.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a single mom of two tots, the young men worried me, mostly because they were so idle, sauntering aimlessly down the center of our busy street, lolling on their tiny porch, riding seatless bicycles in languorous, unpredictable, traffic-snarling circles. They were going nowhere very slowly. The yard overgrown, untended and strewn with litter in a neighborhood where the men often came home for lunch to tend already manicured lawns and plant new shrubbery. Why no team uniforms on these kids, no backpacks, no school projects carted home in cardboard boxes?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Unsmiling, they watched me, never crossing the driveway to help with my packages like the other families did, hip me to the garbage schedule, introduce themselves. Growing up, I learned the primary lesson of inner-city survival: Never show fear. Grown, I also knew that ghetto toughness is a necessary mask its purveyors are all too ready to shed; I made eye contact and was proactively nice from Day One. If I didn&#39;t give them the benefit of the doubt, who would?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I learned all their names and gave each a friendly smile -- Mom, too, when she took her rare TV breaks for air. Surprised and grateful, whenever they saw my soccer mom minivan pull up (carless, they were ferried about by a succession of white ladies with the lanyards of various social service agencies dangling round their necks), whoever was lolling about greeted me warmly. I thought we were off to a good start when they called me &quot;Miss Debra&quot; unprompted. Ah, I thought. Poor, but with home training, just as I had been. I can work with this. And the youngest two became instant playmates with my own. Alas, I relaxed too soon. &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Note:&lt;/span&gt; read the letters on the Dickerson piece</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116644686844578920/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116644686844578920&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116644686844578920'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116644686844578920'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/compare-and-contrast.html' title='Compare and contrast'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116644620333277474</id><published>2006-12-18T07:42:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-18T07:50:03.356-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Riding the tiger</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/776759/muqtada-al-sadr.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/239640/muqtada-al-sadr.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.contracostatimes.com/mld/cctimes/news/16260625.htm&quot;&gt;Sadr movement sheds light on turmoil in Iraq&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shiite group has grown in sophistication with its political ties and social service network that helps families in war-torn nation&lt;br /&gt;By Hannah Allam&lt;br /&gt;MCCLATCHY NEWSPAPERS&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;BAGHDAD, Iraq - The day seemed tranquil at Muqtada Sadr&#39;s headquarters for western Baghdad. Pigeons flew overhead, swooping down to perch on palm trees that dotted the courtyard. Uniformed Iraqi police officers and soldiers sipped tea with rugged militiamen or exchanged customary kisses with black-turbaned clerics. Women came to plead for assistance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But calm is always fleeting in Baghdad. At midday, about 50 gunmen stormed the courtyard and ordered everyone inside to stay put and to stay silent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sadr&#39;s Mahdi Army militiamen responded immediately, drawing automatic rifles and pistols from under their winter coats and gathering in a cluster to face the unidentified gunmen. The assailants closed ranks, brandishing shiny revolvers and battered machine guns.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The groups walked toward each other as if in a high-noon duel. A voice from the crowd called for blessings in the name of Islam&#39;s Prophet Muhammad. Sadr&#39;s soldiers began to shout age-old prayers for the prophet and his descendants, then added the Sadr camp&#39;s innovation: &quot;Bring salvation soon, and damn their enemies!&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With the air filled with the clicking sound of weapons being prepared, visiting McClatchy journalists fled.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sudden intrusion of the gunmen into one of Sadr&#39;s most secure strongholds exposed a paradox that dogs the Sadr movement and contributes to the daily bloodletting here: The Mahdi Army is growing larger and more sophisticated, with politicians in the government and a vast social services network that serves thousands of poor Shiites, but the anarchy of the streets makes it hard for the militia&#39;s commanders to rein in their men, much less prevent attacks from rival factions.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even as Sadr presses for more land and power, his grasp over Baghdad remains tenuous.&lt;br /&gt;..........................&lt;br /&gt;These days, the safest route to Sadr&#39;s west Baghdad office runs through an obstacle course of both legal and dubious checkpoints in an area known for kidnappings and car bombings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On Tuesday, there were eight: The first was an imposing roadblock manned by Iraqi army soldiers in camouflage. The next four were guarded by Iraqi police in mismatched uniforms. Then came a couple of apparent militiamen standing in the street with guns, and next, a vehicle search by more plainclothes sentries. Finally, another batch of unidentified guards stopped pedestrians at a coil of razor wire to peer into women&#39;s bags and pat down men for weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gone are the peaceful seminary days. In their place, men in long overcoats hover, casting steely glares on anyone who enters the compound. The courtyard brims with new faces and dialects. Some were distraught Iraqis seeking financial or security help; others were militiamen or workers from Sadr&#39;s social programs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A large poster hung on the wall showing Sadr, the firebrand cleric-turned-commander, alongside fellow Shiite Muslim leader Hassan Nasrallah, head of Lebanon&#39;s Hezbollah. Sadr stood on an American flag; Nasrallah on an Israeli one. The caption read: &quot;Their arrogance is under your feet.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;An elderly blue-eyed woman shuffled in and beseeched Sadr&#39;s representatives for medical assistance for her three sons. Two of them had been shot by U.S. troops, she said, and the third had fallen off a motorcycle while fighting Sunni gunmen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Are they in the imam&#39;s army?&quot; a tall, stern man asked.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Yes, they all are,&quot; the woman replied.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;OK, just give me their names and papers and we&#39;ll sponsor them,&quot; he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..........................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;If we talk about the word &#39;militia,&#39; the Mahdi Army doesn&#39;t fit the description. We are a group of people with a belief,&quot; said Araji, now national director of Sadr&#39;s social programs and a local militia commander. &quot;We call it an army, but it&#39;s not just an army of gunmen. We protect our neighborhoods and provide services for our people.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Araji said he had visited Lebanon and Iran recently to check on the welfare of Iraqis in prisons and refugee camps. When asked whether he had met with Hezbollah chief Nasrallah in Lebanon, he smiled, shook his head and steered the conversation back to his two trips to Iran. On those jaunts, he evaluated the needs of 90,000 Iraqis in exile.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At home, he said, his time is consumed with the displacement of tens of thousands of Iraqis in what he called &quot;one of the biggest crises in modern history.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When told that Sunni Web sites accused him of fielding death squads, Araji scoffed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Let them bring proof,&quot; he said. &quot;We still have many Sunni families in Kadhemiya. No one has been displaced here, but in the hot spots of Karkh, of course, there are problems. It&#39;s the same for Sunnis and Shiites.&quot; Karkh is how residents of Baghdad refer to the largely Sunni side of the city that lies west of the Tigris River.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&#39;Weak government&#39;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Araji said the government had failed so miserably in providing basic services that his office petitioned the local council six months ago to take over the distribution of cooking gas and other supplies. Now, he said with pride, the Mahdi Army delivers gas and kerosene to families throughout Kadhemiya and other heavily Shiite districts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Funding for the projects, he said, comes mainly from 2,000 donation boxes throughout Iraq that are stuffed with cash every week after Friday prayers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It&#39;s a weak government,&quot; he said. &quot;They&#39;re supposed to do this, but we do it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Araji said the Mahdi Army doesn&#39;t seek to replace the Iraqi government, but that it&#39;s obligated to step in until elected officials show results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;..........................................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five minutes later, the gunmen arrived. Araji&#39;s black turban was lost in a tangle of uniformed and plainclothes gunmen, the swish of black robes as women ran for cover, and the glint of sunshine on weapons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a phone call later that night, he dismissed the showdown as &quot;a tribal matter&quot; and emphasized that no one was injured. Kadhemiya was still safe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It was a private matter,&quot; he said, and offered no further explanation&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wow.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116644620333277474/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116644620333277474&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116644620333277474'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116644620333277474'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/riding-tiger.html' title='Riding the tiger'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116644535898641514</id><published>2006-12-18T07:19:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-18T07:35:59.210-05:00</updated><title type='text'>My Space for Art</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/12/18/arts/Saat2a600.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2006/12/18/arts/Saat2a600.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;Denise Parsons&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;“Being an artist is a solo endeavor, and this is a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;safe way to see what others are doing,” says&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Denise Parsons, an art student in San Francisco &lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;who shows her work, above, on the Saatchi site.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/18/arts/design/18saat.html?hp&amp;ex=1166504400&amp;amp;amp;en=39183548d2eb1c4f&amp;ei=5094&amp;amp;partner=homepage&quot;&gt; I Like Ur Art: Saatchi Creates an Online Hangout for Artists&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By CAROL VOGEL&lt;br /&gt;Published: December 18, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Julie Ann Travis , 23, a graduate student at the California College of the Arts in San Francisco, is curious to see what her peers are up to and to share some of her latest work. So recently she posted a self-portrait in which her head is buried in a pile of dirt at Stuart (saatchi-gallery.co.uk/stuart)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The brainchild of the London-based advertising magnate and collector Charles Saatchi, this social networking outlet — a kind of MySpace knockoff for artists — is causing something of a sensation, boosting traffic at the gallery’s Web site overall to more than three million hits a day.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In May Mr. Saatchi, famed for spotting young unknowns and turning them into art-world superstars, created a section on his Web site for artists of all ages to post their work at no charge. It is called Your Gallery, and now boasts contributions by about 20,700 artists, including 2,000 pieces of video art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Everything there is for sale, with neither the buyer nor the seller paying a cent to any dealer or other middleman. About 800 new artists have been signing up each week.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And since Stuart (shorthand for “student art”) went online last month, some 1,300 students (including 450 in the United States) have created Web pages there. No one vets the quality or style of the art.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With dealers and collectors scouring student shows for undiscovered talent and students hunting for dealers to represent them, Mr. Saatchi has tapped a vein that can’t stop gushing. If Stuart gains anything like the cachet of MySpace, it has the potential to morph from a nonprofit venture into a gold mine for Mr. Saatchi.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For now, he said, he is simply enjoying the role of spectator. “When I launched the site, I took the view that the best thing was to leave it alone for the first year and purposely not buy anything, because I didn’t want to compromise what the site was supposed to do: appeal to a wide group of students,” he said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His office, meanwhile, is fielding e-mail messages and calls from dealers, museum curators and directors, and collectors around the world who have discovered new work at the site and want to meet some of the artists in their studios. (Of the 20,700 or so artists at Your Gallery, roughly 6,000 are from Britain and 6,000 from the United States, with the rest scattered across the world.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But for students visiting Stuart, the main attraction for now is linking up with their peers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to lists of her favorite artists, books, films and television shows, Ms. Travis has posted the name of a new friend on her page at Stuart: Erhan Ozturk, a photography student at T. C. Maltepe University in Istanbul whose work she viewed at the site.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When I saw this story, I was semi-interested, but after playing around on it, I realized it had &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artroom/drawing/&quot;&gt;a kid&#39;s section&lt;/a&gt; which you could do your own paintings with. Since my niece is a budding artist, I found that fascinating. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artroom/drawing/&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keep it handy for your kids over Christmas week, so they can use them on their new boxes.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116644535898641514/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116644535898641514&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116644535898641514'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116644535898641514'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/my-space-for-art.html' title='My Space for Art'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116644338691202958</id><published>2006-12-18T06:57:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-18T07:03:06.953-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Why I hate Disney</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/445864/xmas_santa05alg.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/911666/xmas_santa05alg.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;I thought C0ke owned Santa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6189521.stm&quot;&gt;Disney tells Santa clone ho-ho no&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When James Worley paid a visit to Disney World in Florida his portly frame and white beard soon had kids asking: &quot;Are you Santa Claus?&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Not wanting to disappoint, Mr Worley, 60, played along with some &quot;ho-ho-hos&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Disney officials descended, telling him to stop the impersonation or get out of the park.

It finally felt like what I thought a relationship should feel like. I was incredibly happy, but also afraid that my boyfriend would find out something about my past that would change how he felt about me. He seemed uncomfortable with the number of people I had slept with, but it wasn&#39;t a huge issue.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;One night, after talking about a friend of ours who met his girlfriend in a threesome, he asked me if I had ever been in one. It didn&#39;t occur to me to lie, particularly about something I consider so minor, so I answered honestly and told him yes.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;After that, everything changed. The night I told him I&#39;d had a threesome, he cried and said he felt sick. He became so angry with me that he began to pick at me, and it seems like everything I do is wrong. Overnight, I went from being in a relationship that made me even more confident and happy with myself to being in a relationship that brings me down and constantly reminds me of my shortcomings.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;It&#39;s been six months since he found out. I asked him to get therapy, and he saw two people. He said none of their suggestions helped (one suggested that he laugh it off and make it into a joke), and they seemed to run out of ideas. Now it&#39;s like he&#39;s given up. We hardly ever have sex anymore, because when we have sex, he thinks about my past. He says that he sees sex as sacred, and even though he&#39;s not religious, he has all of these rules on what is right and what is wrong. I&#39;m not asking for his approval of my past actions, just understanding and forgiveness. I&#39;ve tried explaining my past and why I did the things that I did, and I&#39;ve tried to make him understand how much he means to me and how much I value sex with him, but nothing seems to make any difference. I&#39;d made a couples therapy appointment for us, but he &quot;has something to do then&quot; and says he wouldn&#39;t feel comfortable talking about this stuff to a therapist in front of me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;I can&#39;t keep feeling so ashamed of a past I had come to terms with, but I also can&#39;t bring myself to give up on someone that I love so much. Before the threesome fiasco, we&#39;d been talking about marriage and our future, and now I wonder how he could have meant any of that. If he loved me so much, how could his love and respect for me be so conditional? Is there anything he can do to get over this, or am I going to have to forget about how good things used to be and move on? It&#39;s Christmastime, and here I am trying to figure out where to live and who gets the cats and how on earth I can handle all of this hurt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Regretting Telling&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Dear Regretting,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This guy is nuts. What&#39;s wrong with having a threesome?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;No, don&#39;t marry him. Get away from him. He sounds crazy. Not to be too judgmental, but really.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;OK, so let&#39;s say it triggered something in him, some deep-seated fear or whatever. Fine. So the loving thing to do would be to admit to you that he&#39;s acting crazy and irrational and commit to work on it and forgive you for what you did as if you even needed forgiving but most of all since he&#39;s the one who needs forgiving he should ask for your forgiveness for being such a jerk about something that happened before you were together, and if you suggest to him that you&#39;re going to go to couples therapy to work with it then FOR GOD&#39;S SAKE HE SHOULD AGREE TO GO. Not say he has something to do that day. That&#39;s lame. He&#39;s being a jerk about this. &lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116642968189598959/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116642968189598959&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642968189598959'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642968189598959'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/idiot-move.html' title='Idiot move'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116642845106600924</id><published>2006-12-18T02:49:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-18T02:54:11.083-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Don&#39;t dump your snake</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061217/capt.5a819d4b71e744f9aa7f725461b18cd3.python_detectives_nyol702.jpg?x=380&amp;y=285&amp;amp;sig=Bqf0GgMjJrec65y.ORpSUQ--&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer; width: 320px;&quot; src=&quot;http://d.yimg.com/us.yimg.com/p/ap/20061217/capt.5a819d4b71e744f9aa7f725461b18cd3.python_detectives_nyol702.jpg?x=380&amp;y=285&amp;amp;sig=Bqf0GgMjJrec65y.ORpSUQ--&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-size:78%;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(AP Photo/Everglades National Park, Lori Oberhofer, File)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20061217/ap_on_sc/the_python_detectives&quot;&gt;Biologists hunt invasive pythons in Fla.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By TODD LEWAN, AP National Writer Sun Dec 17, 1:22 PM ET&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;EVERGLADES NATIONAL PARK, Fla. - &quot;SNAKE!&quot; Hearing this shout, Skip Snow slammed on the brakes. When the off-roader plowed to a halt, he and his partner, Lori Oberhofer, leaped out and took off running toward two snakes, actually — a pair of 10-foot Burmese pythons lying on a levee, sunning themselves.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After slipping, sliding and tumbling down a rocky embankment, Snow, a wildlife biologist, grabbed one of the creatures by the tail. The python, Oberhofer says, did not care much for that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;It made a sound like Darth Vader breathing,&quot; she says, &quot;and then its head swung around and I saw this white mouth flying through the air.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Snow saw the mouth, too — the jaws open 180 degrees, the gums an obscene white, the needle-sharp teeth bared in an almost devilish grin. He let out a shriek, then blinked, and when his eyes opened the python&#39;s head was hanging in mid-air, less than a foot from his own.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oberhofer, with a Ninja-like thrust, had snared the python in mid-strike.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;I snagged it right behind its head, on its neck,&quot; the 43-year-old wildlife technician recalls. &quot;It was pure reflex — a defensive move. I don&#39;t know if I could ever do it again.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The python hadn&#39;t succumbed yet, however. &quot;They defecate on you, on purpose, hoping to make you reconsider what you&#39;re doing,&quot; Oberhofer says. &quot;It&#39;s not pleasant.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, the humans were victorious, if not sweet-smelling: Both snakes were bagged, trucked off to the Everglades Research Center, euthanized and necropsied — meaning their innards were dissected, then meticulously inspected, for the benefit of science.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So goes python control in the Everglades, a painstaking, around-the-clock slog against a voracious, foreign snake species that has established a stronghold in this watery wilderness and put native wildlife at risk.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Critters that pythons find most delectable — raccoons, possums, muskrats and native cotton rats — are already under attack, as are birds such as the house wren, pied-billed grebe, white ibis and limpkin.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Scientists also worry that these slithery giants — which have been known to grow as long as 26 feet — may soon start to feast on native species whose survival is in doubt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;The Everglades doesn&#39;t work by itself anymore,&quot; says Leon Howell, 58, who has been associated with the park for the last 21 years as a visitor, naturalist, fishing guide and, presently, park ranger. &quot;This whole landscape has to be managed today: water, fire, exotics — you name it.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which explains the evolution of Snow and Oberhofer into a human firewall against non-native exotics. Without them, Howell figures, &quot;there&#39;d be pythons all over the place.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116642845106600924/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116642845106600924&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642845106600924'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642845106600924'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/dont-dump-your-snake.html' title='Don&#39;t dump your snake'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116642791062167709</id><published>2006-12-18T02:36:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-18T02:45:10.663-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The unit in action</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/427672/Terrorism%20-%20Masked%20man%20pointing%20gun.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/514018/Terrorism%20-%20Masked%20man%20pointing%20gun.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-intel18dec18,0,3935943.story?coll=la-home-headlines&quot;&gt;U.S. SEEKS TO REIN IN ITS MILITARY SPY TEAMS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Special Forces units work in allied countries and clash with the CIA.&lt;br /&gt;By Greg Miller, Times Staff Writer&lt;br /&gt;December 18, 2006&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;WASHINGTON — U.S. Special Forces teams sent overseas on secret spying missions have clashed with the CIA and carried out operations in countries that are staunch U.S. allies, prompting a new effort by the agency and the Pentagon to tighten the rules for military units engaged in espionage, according to senior U.S. intelligence and military officials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The spy missions are part of a highly classified program that officials say has better positioned the United States to track terrorist networks and capture or kill enemy operatives in regions such as the Horn of Africa, where weak governments are unable to respond to emerging threats.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the initiative has also led to several embarrassing incidents for the United States, including a shootout in Paraguay and the exposure of a sensitive intelligence operation in East Africa, according to current and former officials familiar with the matter. And to date, the effort has not led to the capture of a significant terrorism suspect.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some intelligence officials have complained that Special Forces teams have sometimes launched missions without informing the CIA, duplicating or even jeopardizing existing operations. And they questioned deploying military teams in friendly nations — including in Europe — at a time when combat units are in short supply in war zones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The program was approved by Secretary of Defense Donald H. Rumsfeld in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, and is expected to get close scrutiny by his successor, Robert M. Gates, who takes over today and has been critical of the expansion of the military&#39;s intelligence operations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Senior officials at the CIA and the Pentagon defended the program and said they would urge Gates to support it. But they acknowledged risks for the United States in its growing reliance on Special Forces troops and other military units for espionage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;We are at war out there and frankly we need all the help that we can get,&quot; said Marine Maj. Gen. Michael E. Ennis, who since February has served as a senior CIA official in charge of coordinating human intelligence operations with the military. &quot;But at the same time we have to be very careful that we don&#39;t disrupt established relationships with other governments, with their liaison services, or [do] anything that would embarrass the United States.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ennis acknowledged &quot;really egregious mistakes&quot; in the program, but said collaboration had improved between the CIA and the military.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;What we are seeing now, primarily, are coordination problems,&quot; Ennis said in an interview with The Times. &quot;And really, they are fewer and fewer.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue underscores the sensitivity of using elite combat forces for espionage missions that have traditionally been the domain of the CIA.&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delta Force otherwise known as the Unit, the TV show is based on the memoirs of one of early members and who also consults on it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The point is that Rummy unleashed other teams to do the same thing and it backfiring because the skill sets are different.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Army handpicks the Unit. They aren&#39;t handpicking all these other teams.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116642791062167709/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116642791062167709&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642791062167709'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642791062167709'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/unit-in-action.html' title='The unit in action'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116642627455498605</id><published>2006-12-18T02:13:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-18T02:17:54.566-05:00</updated><title type='text'>What they want</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

None of the people who spoke about the exchange were willing to be identified.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ten players were ejected after the fight, which started when Mardy Collins, a Knicks rookie, clobbered J. R. Smith of the Nuggets as he was driving for a basket.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some of these players, and possibly Thomas, are expected to receive suspensions today after a review of the videotape and interviews of players, coaches and security personnel.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The league is certain to punish Anthony, its leading scorer and one of its brightest young stars, for throwing a punch at Collins. As for Thomas, a Hall of Fame guard who is now fighting to hold on to his job, the situation is unusual because there is no known precedent for a team’s coach, let alone its president, to be punished for instigating a fight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With 1 minute 32 seconds left, the MSG broadcast focused on Thomas while Denver’s Marcus Camby shot free throws. The Nuggets were leading, 117-100. Thomas, standing on the sideline, his arms folded and his jaw tight, bites his lip and starts talking to a Nuggets player. The player is not in the camera shot, but the broadcaster Mike Breen notes that Thomas is talking to Anthony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There is no audio of Thomas, but in repeated viewing of the video he appears to say: “Hey, don’t go to the basket right now. It wouldn’t be a good idea.” Seconds later, Thomas cocks his head, holds out his right palm and, with a slight smile, adds, “Just letting you know.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The broadcast did not capture the entire exchange, however, as the network toggled between cameras. Thomas also told Anthony that he “shouldn’t be in the game right now,” because the score was lopsided and the Knicks had removed most of their starters, according to an associate who spoke with Thomas yesterday. The message was intended as a plea not to embarrass the Knicks further. The associate was not authorized to speak on Thomas’s behalf and spoke on condition of anonymity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Calvin Andrews, Anthony’s agent, confirmed that Anthony said Thomas had told him to stay away from the area under the basket. Andrews indicated that Anthony gave that account to N.B.A. officials. Thomas also spoke to league officials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The issue for N.B.A. officials is how to interpret Thomas’s words, and his intent. Was Thomas merely advising a young star that he should not embarrass the Knicks by running up the score? Or was he issuing a warning?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the game — but before Thomas’s comments came to light — Thomas gave reporters his account of that conversation with Anthony.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I just said to him: ‘You’re up 19 with a minute and a half to go. You and Camby really shouldn’t be in the game right now.’ We had surrendered. And those guys shouldn’t have been in the game at that time,” Thomas said. “They were sticking it to us pretty good. They were having their way with us pretty good. I think J. R. Smith had just made one dunk where he reverses it and spins in the air. I thought that Mardy didn’t want to have our home crowd see that again and he fouled him.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;The Knicks were off yesterday, and team officials declined to comment on the incident or Thomas’s actions. Neither James L. Dolan, chairman of Madison Square Garden, which owns the Knicks, nor Steve Mills, the Garden president, will be commenting on the matter at any point, a company spokesman said.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Cowards.

Jones Jr. had been president of Trinity College for two years before a black student pointed out to him that he always ate lunch on the side of the dining hall where white students gather.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since that day last month, Mr. Jones, who is white, has made a point of taking a table on the other side, with the minority students.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He also bought the book “Why Are All the Black Kids Sitting Together in the Cafeteria?” for his office, and recently handed out 45 copies to the college’s trustees and senior administrators as “required reading.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I didn’t even know I was eating on the white side,” Mr. Jones said.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trinity officials, professors and students have been forced to reexamine their daily interactions with one another this semester after a series of racially polarizing events that have drawn widespread complaints from minorities over what they see as a climate of incivility and intolerance within their privileged campus of Gothic spires.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From classrooms to hip-hop concerts, the angry dialogue has led to some student protests and focused an unusual level of scrutiny on the college’s practices and policies.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since October, two minority women have reported that racial slurs were scribbled on message boards outside their dorm rooms.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another student, who is white, painted himself black for a Halloween fraternity party and then posed for pictures that turned up on a popular Web site, Facebook.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, many of Trinity’s minority students said they had long felt discriminated against.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some black students said they were regularly stopped at the campus library and asked to show identification while their white classmates just walked in, and at least one Hispanic professor complained to his colleagues of being mistaken for a janitor.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Minority students and their supporters have staged protests, including one in which students spread out in the dining hall to desegregate it for a night, and called upon college officials to improve social relations by taking steps such as spelling out a racial harassment policy in the student handbook, incorporating race issues into the curriculum, and providing more financial aid as a way to broaden the socioeconomic diversity of the student body.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I feel more tension here than ever before,” said Ashlei Flemming, 19, a junior from West Palm Beach, Fla., adding that white students have avoided making eye contact and turned away from her because she is black. “There are times when I want to feel good about Trinity, and then I walk out and I’m reminded of the underlying disgust that we have here for each other.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But other students like Chandler Barnard, who is white, said that they have not seen any discrimination against minorities on campus. “I kind of think it is blown out of proportion a little bit,” said Mr. Barnard, a 20-year-old junior who said his hometown, Lubbock, Tex., is much more conservative on such social issues. “&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;I don’t see it as that big of a problem.”&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116642512241436613/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116642512241436613&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642512241436613'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642512241436613'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/we-dont-see-it.html' title='We don&#39;t see it'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116642464889514461</id><published>2006-12-18T01:46:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-18T01:50:48.973-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Idiocy in action</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot;

However, they declined to say what the action was, saying it was a personnel matter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I think he’s an excellent teacher,” said the school principal, Al Somma. “As far as I know, there have never been any problems in the past.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Staci Snider, the president of the local teacher’s union, said Mr. Paszkiewicz (pronounced pass-KEV-ich) had been assigned a lawyer from the union, the New Jersey Education Association. Two calls to Mr. Paszkiewicz at school and one to his home were not returned.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this tale of the teacher who preached in class and the pupil he offended, students and the larger community have mostly lined up with Mr. Paszkiewicz, not with Matthew, who has received a death threat handled by the police, as well as critical comments from classmates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Greice Coelho, who took Mr. Paszkiewicz’s class and is a member of his youth group, said in a letter to The Observer, the local weekly newspaper, that Matthew was “ignoring the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, which gives every citizen the freedom of religion.” Some anonymous posters on the town’s electronic bulletin board, Kearnyontheweb.com, called for Matthew’s suspension.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On the sidewalks outside the high school, which has 1,750 students, many agreed with 15-year-old Kyle Durkin, who said, “I’m on the teacher’s side all the way.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While science teachers, particularly in the Bible Belt, have been known to refuse to teach evolution, the controversy here, 10 miles west of Manhattan, hinges on assertions Mr. Paszkiewicz made in class, including how a specific Muslim girl would go to hell.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“This is extremely rare for a teacher to get this blatantly evangelical,” said the Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit educational association. “He’s really out there proselytizing, trying to convert students to his faith, and I think that that’s more than just saying I have some academic freedom right to talk about the Bible’s view of creation as well as evolution.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even some legal organizations that often champion the expression of religious beliefs are hesitant to support Mr. Paszkiewicz.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“It’s proselytizing, and the courts have been pretty clear you can’t do that,” said John W. Whitehead, president of the Rutherford Institute, a group that provides legal services in religious freedom cases. “You can’t step across the line and proselytize, and that’s what he’s done here.”&lt;/blockquote&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116642464889514461/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116642464889514461&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642464889514461'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116642464889514461'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/idiocy-in-action.html' title='Idiocy in action'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116640642318046898</id><published>2006-12-17T20:39:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-17T20:47:03.196-05:00</updated><title type='text'>The battle of the wives</title><content type='html'>&lt;a onblur=&quot;try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}&quot; href=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/1600/481588/rice.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;cursor: pointer;&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/2410/214/320/825920/rice.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Snippy, aren&#39;t we, Laura&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.firedoglake.com/2006/12/17/face-the-snark-27/#more-6097&quot;&gt;  Face the Snark&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By: watertiger&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.....................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Well, it would be a rare week indeed during the Bush administration that didn&#39;t find me in front of the television screaming &quot;ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR F**KING MIND?&quot; at least once.  And this week was no exception. With their poll numbers dropping faster than Britney Spears&#39; panties, the Bushes and their &quot;friends&quot; have been in top form, highlighting their mental disconnect from reality with a rococo flourish. In an interview with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20004374_1,00.html&quot; title=&quot;People Magazine&quot;&gt;People Magazine&lt;/a&gt;  this week, the Bushes revealed far more about themselves than I think even they might have intended.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p align=&quot;left&quot;&gt;Laura Bush, in fine Tupperware party fashion, managed to cut off her husband&#39;s &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; wife at the knees: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The President also said there is no doubt in his mind that a woman candidate could be president, and the First Lady agreed. Mrs. Bush referenced Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and noted that while she would be a &quot;really good candidate&quot;, Rice is not interested in the job. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&quot;Probably because she is single, her parents are no longer living, she&#39;s an only child. You need a very supportive family and supportive friends to have this job,&quot; the First Lady said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Oh, hiss-meow, Laura.  You really &lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;have &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;been listening to your mother-in-law, haven&#39;t you. Setting the women&#39;s rights movement back about fifty years, speaking for others who are, at last check, capable of speaking for themselves, disapproving and condescending while trying to appear concerned, and failing to come across as anything other than small-minded, parochial, provincial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I think it has more to do with her attentions towards her husband than politics.

McFADDEN&lt;br /&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A protest march cut a solemn swath through crowds of Christmas shoppers and the joyous mood of the holiday season in Midtown Manhattan yesterday in a rebuke to the police for the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man in Queens on his wedding day last month.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three weeks after Sean Bell was killed and two friends were wounded in a hail of 50 police bullets, a coalition of civil rights groups, elected officials, community leaders, clergymen and others marched down Fifth Avenue and across 34th Street in a “silent” protest that sputtered scattered chants, but was largely devoid of shrieks, speeches and most of the usual sound-and-fury tactics of demonstrations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Billed as a “Shopping for Justice” march and led by the Rev. Al Sharpton, the army of protesters, many carrying placards, moved grim-faced between hordes of holiday shoppers and tourists clogging the sidewalks of two of the city’s busiest commercial arteries.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The police had set up metal barricades to confine the marchers to a single traffic lane, but the throng quickly swelled beyond expectations and the barricades were shifted to widen the line of march to four of the five lanes on Fifth Avenue and five of the six on 34th Street. Traffic on side streets leading to the march was halted as the protesters swept on.&lt;br /&gt;.............................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sampling of shoppers found many against the protest. “We just came here to go shopping at the American Girl store and go see the Rockettes,” said Cherrie Ostigui, 38, of Odenton, Md. “Now we can’t even cross the street to get our lunch.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Steve Diomopoulos, 22, a student from Livonia, Mich., called it “a weird time to be doing this,” and added: “It’s an inconvenience to people like myself who came from out of town and want to get some Christmas shopping done. It’s almost like a hostile atmosphere. I don’t think that’s what people came here to see.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But Seleah Bussey, 22, a Brooklyn College student, said, “I think it’s good because it’s a tourist area and tourists need to know what’s really happening.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Mr. Sharpton, who called the Queens shooting a case of excessive force, said the march was a moral appeal to the city to change police policies.&lt;br /&gt;........................&lt;br /&gt;Besides the complaints of annoyed shoppers, the march generated two negative responses that were aimed at Mr. Sharpton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before the march, Steven A. Pagones, a former assistant prosecutor in Dutchess County who won a defamation suit against Mr. Sharpton and two others in 1998, showed up near the marchers’ rendezvous point.................&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;“I want people to understand that for years he’s made reckless allegations in furtherance of his own agenda,” Mr. Pagones said of Mr. Sharpton.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Michael J. Palladino, president of the Detectives’ Endowment Association, also cited Mr. Sharpton’s role in that matter. “I think it’s all about credibility, something the Rev. Al had forsaken a long time ago in the Tawana Brawley case,” Mr. Palladino said. “He’s trying to deny our police officers their civil rights and due process. But in the end, a grand jury will hear the evidence and they’ll come to a decision.”&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The protesters, many of whom arrived in buses from Queens, Brooklyn and elsewhere, were joined by Representative Charles B. Rangel, City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., and other politicians; by the singer Harry Belafonte; by leaders and members of the N.A.A.C.P.; the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s Rainbow/PUSH Coalition; Mr. Sharpton’s National Action Network; and relatives and friends of Mr. Bell, Mr. Guzman and Mr. Benefield.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The group included Mr. Bell’s fiancée, Nicole Paultre, who has taken the surname Bell, and one of their two children, Jada, 4, and Abner Louima, the Haitian immigrant sodomized with a broomstick by a police officer in a station house nine years ago. Mr. Benefield rode in a wheelchair, but Mr. Guzman, shot numerous times, remained at a rehabilitation center.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.........................&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Palladino is an especially stupid man. Pagones didn&#39;t say shit when Sharpton ran for president, now he has something to say. Too bad for him and Palladino, most of the protesters think he got paid for raping Tawana Brawley. Bringing him out only has one effect, to enrage people. They think he&#39;s a criminal who raped a little girl, lied and got paid for it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, that isn&#39;t my opinion, but the fact that opinion is out there and matters, should been factored in. And it wasn&#39;t. The city has changed, and the police unions don&#39;t get that. I&#39;ll discuss more of that later, but for now there is one central fact, they marched down fifth avenue &lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;without a permit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bloomberg and Kelly have dicked around marchers since 2003. When United for Peace and Justice wanted a similiar march, they were offered the West Side Highway. Then refused the use of the Great Lawn. Leslie Cagan never got a straight answer from City Hall, They have terrorized Transportation Aletrnatives.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the unions took over the streets, arrests followed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But this time, Sharpton, flanked by the city&#39;s unions and minority leaders, said they were going  to march down 5th Ave. No one asked about any permits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And that is going to make a difference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/feeds/116640556437514267/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=5652560&amp;postID=116640556437514267&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116640556437514267'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/5652560/posts/default/116640556437514267'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://stevegilliard.blogspot.com/2006/12/remarkable-sight.html' title='A remarkable sight'/><author><name>Steve</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07982174890330482391</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-5652560.post-116638914343264575</id><published>2006-12-17T15:57:00.000-05:00</published><updated>2006-12-17T15:59:03.456-05:00</updated><title type='text'>Who would do this?</title><content type='html'>Gorilla Guides has this up&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gorillasguides.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;Main Story&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actually there are two main stories - you can&#39;t take them in isolation.

The modus operandi was identical to previous mass kidnappings including the one in al-Sanak during the week and the November attack on the health ministry. It&#39;s worth repeating what I said back then because an extremely clear pattern has emerged:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; margin: 0px 0px 5px 10px; float: right; width: 250px;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/5613/1565/1600/751643/20061217_composite_graphic_2panel_red_crescent_kidnapping.jpg&quot; style=&quot;margin: 0px 0px 10px; display: block; width: 250px; height: 665px; text-align: center;&quot; title=&quot;relatives and workers react to kidnapping&quot; alt=&quot;relatives and workers react to kidnapping&quot; height=&quot;665&quot; width=&quot;250&quot; /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;padding: 3px; display: block;&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1.&lt;/strong&gt; A worker at the Redcrescent Office reacts to the kidnapping.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2.&lt;/strong&gt; A relative of one of the kidnap victims.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; padding: 10px; background: rgb(230, 230, 230) none repeat scroll 0% 50%; -moz-background-clip: -moz-initial; -moz-background-origin: -moz-initial; -moz-background-inline-policy: -moz-initial; margin-right: 275px;&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There&#39;s really not much to be said about this. You&#39;re well capable of working out why a ministry under Sadrist control came under attack. &lt;strong&gt;The health ministry complex is in central Baghdad.That area is under green zone government Ministry of Defense contro. Which is to say that it&#39;s under SCIRI control.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[snip]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack was very well coordinated it was very well planned it consisted of a concerted mortar barrage followed by in the region of 100 gunmen storming the complex. Snipers covered their attack and shot at people trying to escape the complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In broad daylight in Bab al-Mu&#39;adham for crying out loud 100 masked gunmen were able to storm a major ministry complex with in the region of 2,000 people inside. &lt;strong&gt;To get to Bab al-Mu&#39;adham you have to go through checkpoint after checkpoint after checkpoint. And that&#39;s not including the checkpoints in Bab al-Mu&#39;adham itself&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They had help - they had a lot of help.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://gorillasguides.blogspot.com/2006/11/health-ministry-attack.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Link to posting&lt;/a&gt; (emphasis has been added.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pattern is identical and very very blatant, in each case it has been in an area that&#39;s heavily patrolled by SCIRI controlled forces. In each case it has been in an area to which to gain access you have to go through checkpoint after checkpoint after checkpoint controlled by SCIRI forces. In each case it has been in an area in which to move around you have to go through checkpoint after checkpoint after checkpoint controlled by SCIRI forces. In each case it has been in an area in which to leave you have to go through checkpoint after checkpoint after checkpoint controlled by SCIRI forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s what happened today you can see very easily how it fits the pattern. It&#39;s important to know that SCIRI control Karadah.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;A large convoy of SUVs identical to those used by Interior Ministry forces arrive at the building. In this case there were at least 10 SUVs. Even by current standards that&#39;s a pretty hefty convoy.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A large number of gunmen storm the building - in other words there was shooting, a lot of shooting, between them and those guarding it. Nobody came to investigate the shooting. Both the SCIRI controlled Interior ministry and the SCIRI controlled Defense Ministry deny that anyone reported it. The SCIRI controlled police deny that anyone reported it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In this particular &quot;incident&quot; the gunmen also attacked the Dutch Embassy and captured three of the embassy guards. Are we supposed to believe that the embassy didn&#39;t call for help?&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The kidnappers go through the building fairly quickly but very thoroughly - in other words they knew the layout of the building - the plans for buildings such as the Red Crescent Building are on file, you get absolutely no prizes whatsoever for guessing which ministry has those files.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;According to people present in the Red Crescent building the gunment &quot;in the uniforms of&quot; the SCIRI controlled special forces took the time to confiscate all the mobile phones they could find.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;They even recorded on video cameras brought along for the purpose what they were doing.&lt;/em&gt; Don&#39;t believe me?&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;A woman who was present at the scene when the gunmen stormed the building told VOI &#39;the kidnapers took all the mobiles found with the people present at the office while one of the attackers was recording the kidnapping with a video camera.&#39; &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The gunmen then drove off taking their victims with them.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brigadier Abdul-Karim Khalaf (appointed by SCIRI), denies all knowledge of any details of the incident, despite the fact that those detail are being broadcast on several radio stations and carried on Iraqi news sites.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Brigadier Abdul-Karim Khalaf (appointed by SCIRI), makes a statement saying that the SCIRI controlled Interior ministry and the SCIRI controlled Defense Ministry, and the SCIRI controlled police, are busily engaged in setting up check points, roadblocks, and &quot;making investigations.&quot; - &lt;em&gt;Yeah right. The good brigadier doesn&#39;t have far to look. Neither do the American advisers in the Ministry to whom he reports directly.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let it not be forgotten that a senior Red Crescent Official complained on Friday that the biggest problems the organisation have are with the American invaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now lets look at the Dental Hospital Attack. (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aswataliraq.info/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;amp;file=article&amp;sid=33313&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;URI&lt;/a&gt; (Arabic on Aswat Al Iraq)) You&#39;ll notice the same MO. This time it didn&#39;t work. And yes it&#39;s Sadrist controlled nearly all the health facilities are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ol&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Dental faculty is in Bab al-Muaadham very close indeed to the Sadrist controlled Health Ministry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;em&gt;I repeat the area is massively under the control of SCIRI and that to get into, out of, or around, the area you have to go through innumerable checkpoints all manned by heavily armed forces loyal to SCIRI controlled ministrys.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Health Ministry was &lt;a href=&quot;http://gorillasguides.blogspot.com/2006/11/health-ministry-attack.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;the scene of a massive attack in November&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;A convoy of gunmen drive up&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;They open fire and attempt to storm the building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;This time heavy fire from the guards drive them off&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;So they withdraw - somehow or another managing an impossible feat which is to get out of the neighbourhood avoiding all the SCIRI controlled roadblocks to say nothing of any American roadblocks and patrols. I&#39;d love to know how they managed that trick.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;No don&#39;t bother I already know how they managed that trick:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Al Hakim and Bush&quot; title=&quot;Al Hakim and Bush&quot; src=&quot;http://photos1.blogger.com/x/blogger/5613/1565/1600/324509/Death%20Squad.jpg&quot; height=&quot;310&quot; width=&quot;350&quot; /&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;&lt;p&gt;markfromireland&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;See also:&lt;/span&gt; various Western Reports Below - mfi:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.icrc.org/web/eng/siteeng0.nsf/htmlall/irak-news-171206&quot;&gt;ICRC calls for immediate and unconditional release of Iraqi Red Crescent staff abducted in Baghdad&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Press Release 06/144&lt;br /&gt;ICRC calls for immediate and unconditional release of Iraqi Red Crescent staff abducted in Baghdad&lt;br /&gt;The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) called today for the immediate and unconditional release of all persons abducted from one of the Iraqi Red Crescent Society offices in Baghdad.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Geneva (ICRC) - Some 30 persons, most of them Iraqi Red Crescent workers, were kidnapped by unidentified armed men in the morning of 17 December from their duty station in the Iraqi capital.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly thereafter, ICRC Director of Operations Pierre Krähenbühl appealed for the unconditional and immediate release of the Iraqi Red Crescent personnel and of all others abducted with them. &quot;I call upon those who carried out the kidnapping at the Iraqi Red Crescent office to immediately release all the abducted persons unharmed,&quot; he said. &quot;Iraqi Red Crescent workers provide vital help for all Iraqis in need.

The cast of contributers at the end reads very much like one of the great neocon &quot;papers&quot; done up before their return to power under Bush 41&#39;.  I have in mind the &quot;Clean Break&quot; paper which contained so much of &quot;future history.  The military men listed among the supposed authors are a mystery to me.  I know who some of them are but I question how much they really understood what was going to be said in their names.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The paper urges a &quot;surge&quot; of many thousands more US troops into Baghdad beginning in March, 2007 for one more grand roll of the iron dice.  The concept seems to be based on the notion that Shia militias exist because of Sunni violence against them rather than as expressions of a Shia drive to political dominance in Iraq.  Based on that belief the authors seem to believe that if the additional US and Iraqi forces to be employed in the Capital area defeat (destroy?) the Sunni insurgent groups, then the Shia militia armies will &quot;wither away&quot; from a lack of need.  I do not think that belief is justified.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The authors assert that contrary to General Schoomaker&#39;s appraisal below in&quot;State of the Army,&quot; such a surge will not &quot;break the Army.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;They also assert that with an increase in recruiting the brigades that would be missing from the present rotation queue because of this &quot;surge&quot; could be replaced with the one year or so period of the &#39;surge.&#39;  I doubt that this is a realistic appraisal of how long such a process of unit creation would take.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;One of the tasks to be accomplished by the &quot;surged&quot; force would be to disarm the Mahdi&#39;s Army and the other Shia militias.  The authors seem unclear as to whether or not the militias will fight to avoid being disarmed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This concept is a recipe for a grandand climactic battle of attrition between US and Iraqi forces on one side and the some combination of Sunni and Shia forces on the other.  The Sunnis and Shia would not necessarily &quot;ally&quot; themselves to each other, but a general co-belligerence against our people would be bad enough.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;President Bush may well accept the essence of this concept.  He wants to redeem his &quot;freedom agenda,&quot; restore momentum to his plans and in his mind this might &quot;clear up&quot; Iraq so that he could move on to Iran.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The carnage implicit in this concept would be appalling.  The authors have much to say about the consequences of defeat in Iraq, but, I wonder if they have contemplated what it would be like to fail in their climactic battle and still be required by &#39;43 to stay in Iraq.  pl&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/files/200612141_choosingvictory6.pdf&quot;&gt;Download 200612141_choosingvictory6.pdf&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;entry-body&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://turcopolier.typepad.com/sic_semper_tyrannis/files/200612141_choosingvictory6.pdf&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Recriut?
